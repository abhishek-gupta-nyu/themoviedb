Removing Corden doesn't fix this mess, but it would have been a start. I can't say I don't recommend it; these are great songs and sung well here. I would catch myself smiling at the musical numbers, and I haven't stopped listening to the soundtrack. The film's opening credits are just the actor's names in the logo font, and I got chills with the score and seeing that on the big screen, with Rannells and Kidman reason alone to watch, along with newcomer Pellman. I love musicals - they have an energy no other genre has, but the lesson from 'The Prom' is the same as 'Cats': make something that's not for the masses, but true to the story. 

Also, the movie gets Streep to rap in the credit's song, and that's honestly amazing.

A solitary man lies in a hospital bed, alone on Christmas Eve. As his life flashes before his eyes, he confronts the joys and sorrows of his past, present and future. As the timelines overlap, he re-experiences the exhilaration of falling in love, the bond of friendship, the pain of losing his sister, and the fear of what lies ahead in the afterlife. When the spirit of his best friend appears before him, Scrooge (Blake Hackler) must make a choice between a renewed life or permanent damnation.

So, the harder he tried to be the professional in the field of avant-garde art, the more critical and provocative he seems to be. But his colleagues, artists, who often became objects of Avdei’s provocations, and even representatives of authorities tolerated him. But once, during Moscow's Art Manege Fair in December 1998, Ter-Oganian conducted a scandalous performance: with a hatchet, he destroyed several icons - cheap objects, one he painted over with a profanity. His performance caused public protests towards his mistreatment of these icons, although they were just objects sold for tourists as souvenirs on the streets.

Instead, the violinist decided to create somewhat of an extended, glorified music video with elaborate set pieces and costumes — elements that wouldn’t work in a live show because they’d take too long to remove or load on and off a truck each night. Doing this show on a budget, Stirling clocked 16-hour days for two months as creative director, designing the sets, sourcing the costumes and helping develop the choreography (including a performance where she hangs by her hair).",1.4,/cxGbRdKa0q3sEfAZd9dCFJWJfdt.jpg,2020-12-12,0,61.0,Released,,"Lindsey Stirling LIVE, Home for the Holidays",False,0.0,0,"Family,Music,",,,,,0,,,0,0,"Lu Lei,"
