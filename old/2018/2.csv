Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before. It works again, don't get me wrong, _Black Panther_ truly was an experience, both important and fantastic, but to say it re-invented the wheel here, is, to me, an outright lie.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,Overrated and overhyped. Definitely avoid. Watch on redbox if you must.,This is definitely one of Marvel's best because the story is compelling and the characters are well developed. Black Panther and his friends and family must defend themselves and their homeland of Wakanda from the clutches of Klau (Andy Serkis) and Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). Not only is the lead actor great as T'Challa/Black Panther, but the supporting cast does a fine job as well, especially the female actors. T'Challa is surrounded by smart, strong women. Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy. He sort of reminded me of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. Highly recommended if you enjoy comic book movies.,Really good movie. Good story, lots of fun. This is what DC is missing.,It was with some hesitation that I went to see this movie. I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.

I actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.

The story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.

The characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less…well…stupid!

Personally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.

Special effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.

On the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects.,I was really surprised how much I liked this movie.  There was so much going on; immigration concerns; the fight between saving the world and protecting your own country(sound familiar); the fear of an African country’s resources being pillaged; how best to handle the problems black people face worldwide; and many great authentic feeling cultural nods.  All this while not being heavy or preachy.  You can definitely eat popcorn to this.  The villain; Killmonger, is great.  Not great in that he is scary, though he is, but because he is more complex than some shadowy figure you should just trust is a bad guy because of visual effects or dramatic music.  

This movie isn’t just explosions and one-liners in an exotic location.  This is a great movie in general.  It’s always interesting.  There are great relationships between all the characters.  Finally; Wakanda is really a place.  It feels alive and lived in; not just impressive buildings used as a backdrop.  They did a wonderful job of worldbuilding; from the rituals, to the clothing, fancy tech, and scenery.  This movie is definitely worth a watch. 

☆☆☆☆-1/2

I also have to add that; you get to actually see Andy Serkis!  When I saw his name I thought we was going to be some kind of CGI monster.  I’m just happy to see him get actual screen time.,The Black Panther is a fun romp, but it definitely has some issues. First, the good.

The action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. 

While the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. 

In fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.

The story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. 

This is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. 

In addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. 

Despite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It should have been two movies, but I doubt this is the last we'll see of Wakanda.,The character of T'Challa made his debut in Captain America 3: Civil War.

In Black Panther, T'Challa returns to his homeland of Wakanda after the death of his father who has been hiding a secret about his brother who lived in the USA. He now inherits the throne after a challenge from a rival.

Wakanda is an african country with wealth, power and immense technology that it hides from the outside world.

T'Challa's uncle wanted an uprising in the USA. Now his son Killmonger comes to Wakanda and challenges T'Challa for the throne.

Killmonger wins and leads the struggle for black power.

Black Panther is a well made efficient film from Marvel who really have nailed down their formula. The box office avalanche has surprised me. It simply is not that good with a very predictable story.,Overrated due to political correctness; it’s noble and has its points of interest, but it’s also kinda meh
	
RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler, ""Black Panther” details events when T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over kingship of the hidden African nation Wakanda after his father passes (John Kani). The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T’Challa’s reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik “Killmonger” (Michael B. Jordan).

With its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), “Black Panther” was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called “racist” by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie’s likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn’t all that involving. It’s basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even “Ant-Man” (2015).

Still, it’s respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there’s some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a “colonizer,” which isn’t even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.

The waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic’s story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the ""Panther's Rage"" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. 

And it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T’Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It’s a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W’Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn’t acknowledged in this movie; shameful.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguazú Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa. WRITERS: Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (and, uncredited, Don McGregor).

GRADE: B-,Awesome movie,""Black Panther is Marvelous (pun intended)""

T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to his native Wakanda to be crowned king. Not long after he’s challenged for the throne and war looms over his homeland.

Black Panther isn’t your typical hero because let’s face it… He’s black. And apart from Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smeagol (Andy Serkis), everybody’s black. And that’s the way it should be.
The entire cast delivers. Boseman is excellent as king T’Challa who struggles with his new role. It doesn’t get any easierr when Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) shows up. Killmonger is a mean SOB yet you care for him (some good writing right there). He’s a worthy adversary and one of the better Marvel villains. Jordan portrays him perfectly. Director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are a match made in heaven. This is their third collaboration after ‘Fruitvale Station’ and ‘Creed’ and again they’re successful. The movie itself gets better as Jordan’s role gets bigger.

The female characters and actors are equally impressive. Especially Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) and Okoye (Danai Gurira) steal the show.

There’s less humour in ‘Black Panther’ than we’re used to seeing in Marvel films but that’s not a bad thing. The movie doesn’t need it.

Though it’s set in (fictional) Africa there wasn’t any filming done in Africa. Nonetheless the movie looks right. The makers did a great job of creating Wakanda. Huge props to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and composer Ludwig Göransson who help bring Wakanda to life.
On the downside there’s a lot of CGI. Sometimes it’s too obvious (rhinos say hi). Despite that the battle scenes are beautifully choreographed. Especially Okoye wielding her spear is a thing to behold.

All in all ‘Black Panther’ is another wonderful addition to the MCU and we can’t wait to see what role T’Challa and his sidekicks are going to play in ‘Avengers: Infinity War’.,Black Panther will probably be remembered as a culturally significant film more so than a great one, but that shouldn't take away from the movie's deeper theme of inclusivity. This is a really good movie with heart and intelligence.

The fact that I have issues with the pacing, the generic action, or that I don't find Killmonger as complex a villain as the movie thinks is my problem. But I don't understand how people can hate on Black Panther because it integrates social and political themes into its narrative. Isn't contemporary relevance key in determining the greatness of a film?,I really enjoyed this film, it was new uncharted never done before, and they delivered a marvel masterpiece. I look forward to seeing the next one...,overhyped before release and overrated after release, Black Panther is nothing more than another paint by numbers MCU movie, with boring characters and a lead that lacks charisma,Overall Black Panther was an enjoyable movie, directed by Ryan Coogler. It is one of the biggest movies of 2018, with an outstanding cast who includes Chadwick Boseman and Michael b. jordan, amazing special effects, and a plot that leaves you on the downright edge of your seat for 2 hours and 15 minutes. After the tragic death of chadwick, had a thought about watch his movies and this one comes in my mind. This review is my tribute chadwick. This movie is pg-13, but it seems more 10 and up.  The awesome sci-fi action story about a prince of an utopian country facing the incredible truth about his family, <a href=""https://paperhelp.nyc/"">paperhelp</a> and the mantle of the black panther, protector of the country Wakanda, was amazing, and fits in with the mcu series perfectly. I reccomend that you watch Captain america:civil war first, as it would make some elements more understandable If you like superhero action movies, fantasy, or science fiction, come see this awesome movie.,","africa,superhero,based on comic,aftercreditsstinger,duringcreditsstinger,marvel cinematic universe,",78,477,"Ryan Coogler,"

Netflix. Don't go down this road. Let it end here.,It's fine sci-fi schlock. There's a likable cast, a few tense body horror moments, and an interesting idea with a disembodied arm. The mostly generic hodge podge of a script doesn't live up to the potential of the rest of the elements. However, the most glaring flaw is the B-plot, Earth scenes added thanks to test audiences, which doesn't have any bearing on the principal story that happens in space. Thanks, test audiences.,Like Prometheus in 2012, this was a serious disappointment. The characters' decisions are bizarre, motivations are unexplained. The science is bogus. The horror elements are not horrifying. The whole thing lacks style, originality, humour or any kind of spark.

The movie fails to establish any meaningful personality for the crew members, so the only question becomes which one will die next.  OK, there's one potentially interesting idea: have each character speak in their own national language (except the Brazilian guy: not sure why he doesn't get to?!) but the movie fails to take it anywhere.

Even the people I know personally are coming out strongly either for or against it. Normally, those are the kind of movies that I find myself feeling in the middle about. You know, the movies that people say ""You either love it or you hate it, there is no middle ground!""? Yeah, those are the sort of thing I almost always end up giving a five or six out of ten. But with this one? I fall very, very firmly on the side in favour of _Annihilation_. I did **love** it.

Aesthetics is a big part of that, I'm not gonna lie. I'm also digging the chimeric creature design I've seen on Netflix so far this year (in both this and _The Ritual_). But the philosophical stuff is what really does it for me. Annihilation approaches its context in a completely original way, and I for one feel richer for having seen it.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._,In and of itself, the history of Annihilation is not bad.
It has a lot of pictures and camera settings. The individual scenes are told leisurely and you take time for each individual setting. It is also noticeable that the figure drawings of every actress, carries a secret that is gradually revealed. This also makes it a bit more exciting for the narrative strand. Alex Garland also understands how to set the special effects to the perfect scene. The effects are very colorful and you can also notice how he is charging the tension. The creatures are very beautiful, although you know that in the next scene you can't trust the beauty. The meaning of life is also a message from Garland. Where we come from and where we go. Unfortunately, Garland sometimes delays the story too much and then waits in vain until Garland comes to the point. Also the actresses are very well selected and you notice that each of the women have a heavy backpack to wear.
Conclusion: A quiet and lengthy film about the existence and fate of different women bring mood, but a bit more action you would have already given the movie!,It helps to have an open mind and just let yourself go with the flow of the story ... most plot elements align about half-way through the film.

Lovely movie. 😊

I honestly wasn't expecting much, but I wanted to support MercyMe, and I always like to throw my support whenever a movie theater plays a good, clean movie like this one.

I was actually quite amazed by the production. It had the look of a big budget film (I have no idea how much the budget was), and was lacking the cheese element prevalent in so many Christian movies. It was remarkably well cast, and I was particularly impressed by both guys who played Bart - the 11 year old Bart (Brody Rose), and the teenage/20something Bart (J Michael Finley). I also LOVED Trace Adkins as Brickell.

I took my non-believer friend to it, because he likes MercyMe, and has enjoyed Bart's testimonies whenever I've taken him to a concert, and he liked the movie as well. He even teared up, and he is NOT an emotional guy! I cried too, but I'm an emotional girl! 😉

I definitely recommend it. I'm not a person who enjoys going to the movie theater, and usually will only go in special circumstances. I think mainstream America playing a Christian movie in the theater is a special circumstance, and if you want to see more of this happening, I hope you'll go support it.,""Though it will never be championed as an insightful work of either religious art or patriarchal psychology, I Can Only Imagine does manage to be a good film about a great song...""
 
Read the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2018/3/23/i-can-only-imagine.html,***The story behind the popular Christian band***  

Released in 2018, “I Can Only Imagine” is a biopic of Bart Millard (J. Michael Finley) of MercyMe, spanning his childhood, the abuse of his father (Dennis Quaid), meeting his true love (Madeline Carroll), starting the band, low-rent touring, acquiring a manager (Trace Adkins) and eventual success with the band’s titular hit.

While this semi-modest inspirational flick is nowhere near as good as “Coal Miner’s Daughter” (1980) or even “La Bamba” (1987), it’s almost on par with the Johnny Cash biopic “Walk the Line” (2005), although it cost five times LESS and lacks the polish. Finley is an otherwise unknown actor, but he makes for a fine protagonist. And Carroll is winsome and curvy; unfortunately, her part is small.

It’s too by-the-numbers, but I could relate to the father/son issues and the story builds to an inspiring and emotional performance of their hit song.

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes and was shot entirely in Oklahoma.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._,Nothing anywhere near perfect, or even super logical, but I still enjoyed watching <em>'Looking Glass'</em>.

It builds up the tension and darkness well, with the ghost town feel to everything. The cinematography, particularly the lighting, is rather nice. The premise and its execution, while intriguing, does have problems, but the two leads are fun to watch.

Nicolas Cage (Ray) and Robin Tunney (Maggie) make for a good pairing, both give satisfactory performances. Marc Blucas is, I thought anyway, pretty decent in his role as Howard; though the writing does let his character down. Other negatives for the film include the average music and crappy opening credits.

Have to be honest, I had no idea this was filmed on an iPhone 7 or that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh. I was stuck for something to watch on cable the other night and I liked the sound of the plot premise. So unburdened by expectation of a searing horror classic I settled in to see what unfolds.

Plot has Claire Foy as Sawyer Valentini who inadvertently commits herself to a mental health institution. Once inside things being to unravel and the threat of her one time stalker now being even close to her opens up the book of terror - but is it real?

Firstly you have to say that the mental health authorities must have had kittens when they saw this, much of what is on screen is utterly ridiculous and paints the system in a damning light. Secondly you really have to jump on board with the improbability of it all, this really is made for dramatic entertainment purpose and not as a viable horror of the real world.

As a thriller it worked for me, the constant question of what is real or not keeps things on the slow burn. Either way, real or not, it's thought provoking enough to warrant staying till pics end. The psychological angle is pungent enough to say there's some thought in the writing, though this is undone by utter nonsense as things spiral into the impossible for the final quarter of film.

Foy is good value up front and the fulcrum of it all, while elsewhere good work comes from Nate Hoffman and it's nice to see Juno Temple in a spicy role. Ultimately this is no blood letting horror picture, and certainly it's no One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Girl Interrupted etc etc. 

The iPhone experiment is a gimmick that works here due to the confines of the location for story, but as a genre piece of worth it is unlikely to have legs. However, even though I enjoyed this as a one time only viewing experience, I perfectly understand why it has become divisive. So for those who haven't seen it yet then it is advised you understand this is no terrifying thrill a minute piece. It's tricky to recommend with any sort of confidence, and thus I feel the internet ratings of about 6.5/10 is just about right. 6.5/10,Every time Claire Foy is not on the screen, the calibre of acting in _Unsane_ drops to laughable. I'm glad that Soderbergh is able to put together films for the seven-figure price range, but the fact of the matter is that the camera on an iPhone just isn't that good. It's decent enough to (in most scenes) get the visuals across, but never decent enough to not be a distraction. _Unsane's_ tale is relatively well told, but also something that's been done before, and considering the man in the director's chair, something that probably should have been done better too.

Or we would be following them if we weren't already pretty much near the end of an investigation that had been going on for a while.

The really bizarre thing is that, for the tenth movie in the series, you can actually see the potential for a decent and interesting film here. But they drop the ball hard, and it's a potential that they fail to realize on an epic scale.

The main problem here, and I can't believe I'm about to say this, is that the film needed to be longer. More hints at the ultimate solution to the mystery needed to be dropped, enough so that when looking back, the audience could say, ""Yeah, how did I miss that?"" rather than ""Did I miss something?"" It also results in a real lack of characterization, although I have to admit that it's not entire for want of trying.

I like that there are hints at a bigger picture, even if they do fly in the face of established Hellraiser lore. For the first time, we see an actual angelic counterpart to the demonic Cenobites, although the problem here is that the Cenobites were never really established as demons, per se. It's also got a twist ending that's bizarre even by Hellraiser standards, and might have worked if Pinhead in particular were given more of a character in this film. Instead, the ending is entirely dependent on knowledge of him from previous films, but let's be honest here, no one who isn't familiar with the previous films will see this one.

Again, it's not phoned in like the previous Hellraiser film (I can't believe I also have to give credit for the film actually looking like it was filmed with a professional camera and not an iPhone like ""Revelations""), but it's still so sloppy that it falls over itself trying to tell a bigger tale than I think they were ready for, and instead comes off as derivative and vastly disappointing.,","pinhead,sequel,",15,13,"Gary J.

- Xavier Giannoli; _L'Apparition_ Production Notes

_L'Apparition_ [_The Apparition_] is a film with many of the prerequisite ingredients to produce a fine piece of work, not the least of which is an intriguing set-up with a built-in opportunity for weighty social and/or ecclesiastical commentary. However, whilst the idea is sound, the execution is poor, and due to some very basic missteps, the narrative's potential profundity is rendered singularly uninteresting.

Written and directed by Xavier Giannoli (_Marguerite_), with Marcia Romano (_Sous le Sable_; _Marguerite_) and Jacques Fieschi (_Un Cœur en hiver_; _Yves Saint Laurent_; _Mal de pierres_) credited with ""collaboration"", the hook does a fine job of drawing the audience in. Jacques Mayano (Vincent Lindon) is a French photographer just returned from an unspecified war zone where his colleague was killed in a bomb blast. As a result of the explosion, Mayano is having aural problems and suffering from PTSD. Upon returning to France, he quickly becomes directionless, until he is contacted by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints – the body within the Vatican which investigates claims of miracles, with an eye towards possible canonisation. Mayano is told that a young girl named Anna (Galatéa Bellugi) claims to have seen a Marian apparition in a field just outside a small village. However, frustrated with the Vatican asking questions, as well as their scepticism regarding the validity of Anna's claim, the local parish priest, Fr. Borrodine (Patrick d'Assumçao), has cut off contact with the Church hierarchy, and is using a not-unwilling Anna to entice pilgrimages to the area, subsequently encouraging the devout to purchase items in a spectacularly tacky gift store. In an attempt to ascertain the merit, or lack thereof, of Anna's vision, the Congregation want Mayano to head an investigative team.

So far so good. It's a fine _raison d'être_, and the first act is excellent, depicting Mayano learning the Congregation's inner workings, spending time in the Vatican Apostolic Library reviewing documents detailing both valid and invalid (as decreed by the Congregation) instances of miracles, travelling to the village, and meeting his team (a combination of secular and laity). However, once the investigation proper begins, the bottom falls out, as Giannoli seems to have no idea where to take the story.

For a start, the film is far, far too long; clocking in at 144 minutes, it could easily have lost a half-hour without compromising the central narrative drive at all. In fact, the whole thing felt like a workprint; far too much fat on its bones, so much wasted motion, and no editing rhythm within individual scenes, many of which continue for several beats after they have come to what should be their natural conclusion. In tandem with this, there are so many half-developed subplots which never integrate with the main narrative - Mayano's PTSD and hearing problems, orphans, a children's home, adoption, mysterious letters, a missing girl, possible profiteering from Anna's visions. Additionally, with so much going on at a plot level, both Mayano and Anna are extremely under-written, with virtually no character development between them; Mayano is essentially an archetypal ""atheist photographer,"" and Anna is very much a cipher.

However, the biggest problem is that the film simply can't make up its mind as to what it wants to be - an examination of canonical doctrine or a standard mystery. And because of this pseudo-schizophrenic quality, the plot is shaky at best, with the superficial far outweighing the substance. Related to this, the film concludes with a wholly unnecessary and poorly conceived twist that plays out as relatively unrelated to what we've just spent the last two hours watching, focusing as it does on a character we haven't met up to the penultimate scene.

Another problem, given the inherently evocative nature of the subject matter, is that Giannoli misses a perfect opportunity for critique. You'd expect that a contemporary film dealing with what is increasingly looked upon as arcane dogma would engage in some way with the issues that that dogma throws up; the nature of apparitions in both a contemporary and a historical sense; the Church's attitude to instances where they were unable to debunk the claimant; their attitude to cases where they were able to prove a hoax; the process of investigating an apparition, and the Congregation's prerequisites for approving canonisation; their tendency to mix the ordained with the professional on the investigative teams, such as historians, psychologists, and scientists. None of these issues are explored in any way, as the film sets up an intriguing providential-based framework, but then fails to introduce the scrutiny with which to analyse the surrounding themes. Essentially, the film says nothing of interest about anything.

For his part, however, Giannoli certainly seems to think it does. In the film's EPK, he says of Mayano,

> _he has come across a world in which proof counts for nothing and the invisible world keeps its secrets._

And this is essentially where the problem lies; the twist simply doesn't integrate with the rest of the film, and ends up working against the presentation of faith, diluting Giannoli's thematic concerns to the point where it's difficult to tell what he is trying to say. If the film is truly about the invisible world keeping its secrets, why does he feel the need to introduce a twist which thoroughly explains all of those secrets? Similarly, of the Congregation's work, Giannoli states,

> _one should not imagine that the Church hopes for and encourages the authentication of apparitions. On the contrary, I think they are a hindrance to them. Faith doesn't need proof or it's no longer faith._

However, the film is literally about an attempt to find that proof, and once again, the twist compromises the apparent intention. Giannoli also refers to the film as

> _a thorough documentary investigation into the supposed proof of the existence of God._

There's no evidence of this at all in the finished product, where perhaps some kind of engagement with the issues thrown up by, for example, agnosticism or noetics might have been interesting.

And for evidence that films dealing with this kind of deeply esoteric/metaphysical subject matter can work, one need only compare _L'Apparition_ with films such as Jessica Hausner's _Lourdes_ (2009) or Dietrich Brüggemann's _Kreuzweg_ (2014). In _Lourdes_, a woman (Sylvie Testud) confined to a wheelchair makes a pilgrimage to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, hoping to regain the use of her legs, and in the process engages with issues such as the Church as a profit-centred business, the nature of divine healing, and the role of vehement scepticism contrasted with that of blind faith. _Kreuzweg_ tells the story of Maria (Lea van Acken), a fourteen-year-old girl from a fanatical Catholic family, whose only desire in life is to become a saint. With this in mind, she sets about replicating Jesus's path in Golgotha through the fourteen Stations. The film engages with a myriad of conundrums and challenges; an indictment of religious fundamentalism, the nature and power of obsessive faith, the likelihood or unlikelihood of genuine miracles, the place of divinity in the modern world, the Church's attitude to suffering, and the validity of secular interference in ecclesiastical matters. _L'Apparition_ gets nowhere near this level of analysis. Instead, it's two hours plus of serious people acting seriously, but not actually saying anything of note about anything, capped off with as ill-advised a twist as you're likely to see all year.,","vatican,southern france,pilgrimage,jordan,reporter,catholic church,religious fanaticism,apparitions of mary,church inquiry,religious belief,",27,20,"Xavier Giannoli,"

Heather Graham, Angela Kinsey, and Stephanie Beatriz play off each so well in this.  It honestly reminds me of ""Bad Moms"" without kids and less ridiculous.

This is a ""chick flick"" in its truest form.  It's not good (or bad) because of that, but it's just a focus of the movie, feeling lost and empowered as a woman character.  They make an excellent choice in using Chris D'Elia to portray the chauvinist industry of movies (if to a bit of an extreme). 

This is also the second time I've seen Johnny Knoxville play a priest, unsettling both times.

While the concept of candle based witchcraft is somewhat intriguing, it's just a mechanic (same as the workshop) to interweave the multiple story threads.  It would be a little more satisfying if they had a more legitimate bond than ""we met this one time"" established at the beginning of the story.  On the other hand it makes the formula flexible enough that it could be that they joined through AA or a convention, so I can see the use of doing something like this.

The movie is charming, and it's good (refreshing in the very least) to see feminine perspective of a romantic / sex based humor of this quality.

An upper world to be shunned, not sought out. How then have mountains now come to hold a spellbound? Drawing us into their dominion. Often at the cost of lives. Because the mountains we climb are not made only of rock and ice, but also dreams...and desire. The mountains we climb, are mountains of the mind.”

Passages from Macfarlane’s book ‘Mountains of the Mind’ sweep through the piercing crevices of Ozturk’s mountaineering photography, accompanied by Dafoe’s heavenly soothing narration. Exploring the relationship between humanity and mountains across time, “into a space where time warps...and bends”. Providing insight into their alluring endangerment, the mind’s requirement to feel alive. A lust for death-defying experiences where the stoic poses of grandiose mountains intimidate, cursed with the uncontrollable meteorology that governs them. Souls perish beneath the snow encrusted rocks. Others enlightened by the achievement they have just accomplished. “Sensations are thrillingly amplified”. Earth’s most imposing natural wonders of the world, have now become passions. “Our fascination became an obsession”. To conquer. To discover. To relinquish one’s self unto the summits where deities rest.

Mountain refuses to be categorised as just a documentary, but rather cinematic immersion. Enabling nature’s seduction to beguile and mesmerise. Towering peaks hypnotise to the accompaniment of Beethoven and Vivaldi’s stringed odes. The Australian Chamber Orchestra supplying an additional poetic interpretation to the lofty heights of snow-capped summits. Panoramic horizons woven into a methodical observation, edited exquisitely to create a narrative flow. The first expedition to Everest. Humanity’s eternal desire to achieve the unachievable. Modern tourism and its environmental impact. Extreme sports. Nature’s water cycle. A symphony of characteristics brought together to enrapture those who dream of the bone deep cold. Stunning. Bewitching. Photographic beauty that is rarely surpassed onscreen. For every shot of these formidable rock formation, is a mental link that questions the psychology of humanity. A surprisingly affecting and visceral experience.

However, much like the terrain that is captured, its pace is uneven. The balance between physical and human geography tipped towards the latter. Aspects such as the water cycle, volcanic surplus and glacial formations failed to coincide with the human element that enveloped this documentary. Furnishing no insight other than to resemble a rudimentary geography lesson one would watch at school. The daredevil stunts, mountaineering expeditions and environmental detriments were at the forefront, fortunately. Still, even these aspects were depicted unevenly with the environmentalism garnering a total of five minutes of the runtime. Considering the feature is just over an hour long, its secondary message had insufficient time to manifest.

To end this review, a passage from Macfarlane’s book, which should be read just for its exquisite poetry in itself, will suffice and perfectly sum up Mountain as a feature. “Stone and ice though are far less gentle to the hand’s touch than to the mind’s eye. The mountains of the Earth have often turned out to be more resistant, more fatally real, than the mountains we imagine”.,","mountain,extreme sports,sports documentary,geology,natural wonder,",1,13,"Jennifer Peedom,"

Maybe I only was as accepting of _Tonight She Comes_ because of just how **atrocious** the films I watched either side of it were, and I was overly-grateful by comparison, but irrespective of the reasoning, I still thought by the time it was all done that it was... okay. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._,_**Well made and haunting, but the last act is needlessly disgusting and boring**_

Two guys and two girls meet at a remote Missouri property where some strange and horrifying things are happening.

“Tonight She Comes” (2016) is a proficient Indie horror with a good score and haunting vibe, not to mention the lovely Larissa White as protagonist Ashley. The director doesn’t fail to highlight her beauty (not talkin’ ’bout nudity; he uses another actress for that). Despite a couple cavils (like the idiotic masturbation scene and how Pete wanders through the woods to the exact abode where James is delivering mail), it’s very good for the first two acts, but then it devolves into a dull and gross bloody ritual with the requisite tedious gobbledygook. Then there’s the “shocking” final scene that’s too absurd to be taken seriously (think the eye-rolling ending of “Sharknado”).

Nevertheless, the writer/director is clearly talented and will go on to great things if he perseveres. He just needs to work the kinks out of his scripts, like nonsensical or pointless parts. He also needs to grasp that being as disgusting and “shocking” as possible doesn’t make up for compelling storytelling.  

I should add that this isn’t a comedy/horror, as it’s sometimes listed. There are some amusing antics with the youths partying at the small lake, but it’s otherwise serious horror.   

The movie runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, and was shot in Missouri.

But I don't think he had anything to do with the actual making of the film, executive producer is not the same as a producer. 9 times out of 10 all an exectutive producer does is help with funding the film. Which I can see Kanye doing solely because of loyalty to Damon Dash who was the man who made him a star (and because Dash's finances has gone downhill and he felt bad).

The 2nd reason is the fact that Stacey Dash (Damon Dash's cousin) have made statements that Damon Dash (the director and star of the film) was not allowed to use her name to sell the film (which he of course did anyway). She's only in it for a quick cameo but the movie advertised her as being a signifant character in the film (she's definitly not).

Not the first time Damon Dash made that move with her, PAPER SOLDIERS also had her all over the poster etc even though she was only in it for about 9 minutes (which still is 7 and a half more minutes than she is in this one).

Anyway enough about that, the actual movie is very much in the same line as the STATE PROPERTY movies but with even less plot. Gritty and unapologetical it plays almost more like a rulebook for those who wish to lead the life of crime than an actual movie at times, with tons of 'words of wisdom' (it's intended as such at least) in voiceover of why though shalt not snitch and why murder is sometimes a necessity etc when you're 'in the life'.

Damon Dash has the lead (of sorts, I say of sorts because as the movie goes on his role is less and less significant to the story which is a unique way to tell a story I suppose) but the leadroles are kind of fluid tbh, one minute all focus can be on one guy and what he's doing to elevate his power in the game and then it switches to someone else. It's kind of messy really.

There is a crew in the film which is refered to as being 'young and wild' one of which is played by rapper Cam'ron which is an interesting casting choice being that he passed 40 a couple years ago and the other people in his crew are close to the same age as well.

Anyway the first STATE PROPERTY I recall being said that it glorified murder, partly because while the murders were pictured on screen they'd play rap-music well in this film they stay way clear of that, instead in every murder scene they play classical or opera music. I lost count how many slowmotion classic music/opera music murder scenes there was in this but there's alot.

Anyway, while I was ocassionally entertained by the film it's not particulary good and it severly lacks in all aspects of filmmaking.,",,6,3,"Damon Dash,"

It was quite the experience to sit down to watch my dodgy horror movie for the night and realise ""Oh damn, that's classic schmoe Tiffany Smith!"" and so on. Even with that aside, _House of Demons_ was not the typical dodgy horror I was expecting. It's actually got a fair bit of originality, and is really more of a psychedelic moral exploration than the straight up cabin in the woods/haunted house movie I thought I was in store for.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._,_**Irish Indie about a mundane vacation at a holiday home and the (*gasp*) gate to hell nearby**_

A group of friends & family gather at a remote holiday home in rural Ireland, but they’re off-put by the sulfuric stench of a newly opened sinkhole a couple of miles away. The stench will be the least of their cares when a bit o’ hell breaks loose.

“Beyond the Woods” (2018) is an Irish horror Indie that’s mostly mundane drama at the holiday home where the dudes & dudettes hang around drinking & smoking or maybe walking the yard/woods. If you can handle that, things turn horrific in the last act with pretty good infernal f/x, especially for a spare-change Indie. Personally, I enjoyed the lens into everyday social life in Ireland, but others may understandably find it tedious.     

The film runs 1 hour, 23 minutes, and was shot in Cullen (the holiday home & surrounding woods) & Crosshaven (creature nightmare scene), County Cork, Ireland.

While researching his subject, Adi meets Alberto, a Roma ex-convict and a bear of a man, who promises Adi to help him. Soon, the unlikely pair begins a playful romance in which Adi feeds Alberto with improbable plans of escaping poverty and Alberto reciprocates with well-concocted phrases of love. Little by little their casual affair grows into love. And the funny and sweet teasing turns into something precarious, since Alberto is both dangerous and fragile and belongs to a world whose codes Adi doesn't understand.",1.636,/wnCJnqs55KBkdI1fxEWXyzlHW4v.jpg,2/2/2018,0,119,Released,,Soldiers.

Clément Cogitore adapts a short part of the ballet by mobilizing a group of Krump dancers, an art form born in Los Angeles black ghetto in the 1990s.

Amidst this coercive atmosphere, young dancers started to embody the violent tensions of the physical, social and political body.

His immense talent was either less utilized or went unnoticed.

Suri, is a character based Director and casted Dhananjaya perfectly for Daali character in this latest film Tagaru and the result is impactful or has he unleashed a star-villain for Kannada films but care should be taken that Dhananjaya shouldn’t be type casted as he is a star material and will only glide in leaps if the able directors uses his talent properly in future. for both, Tagaru happens to be the 9th film of their careers respectively and their maiden partnership struck the goldmine.

For Suri, Casting such a mammoth star cast with equally talented ones was one of the biggest coups he did in his career. Suri, is a director who very well knows his ability and invests heavily on his craft with all the available resources within his confines. When he made Kendsampige he had to sell off his property to produce it and the outcome was altogether new experience for the audience.

The story of Tagaru is simple and linear. It’s the operation of cleansing society by eliminating the gangsters of same group but what awe-struck the audience is the presentation of the subject ,screenplay, crisp dialogues, razor-sque editing and placing the scenes in a jumbled way which soars and scores heavily and something that reminds of Upendra’s style of film making.

Suri with Tagaru once again ventures into the underworld genre. This genre has been his forte ever since his debut and every time he makes a film in this genre it has a detailing and exploration of the darker side of the society but he makes exception this time by planting a cop in this underworld saga and allows a game between cat and mice.

If the first half goes on killing spree, spilling blood on each frame, depicting grey activities of underworld and placing all the scenes randomly making the audience a bit of restless to connect all the non linear dots linearly; then the second half is all about powerful performances and letting away the plot to thicken giving time for the audience to understand the reasons for restlessness in the first half.

Shivarajkumar is on winning spree these days. He tasted success with Bangara S/o Bangarada Manushya, stamped impeccable authority on Mufti as a Gang-lord and now with Tagaru as a shrewd Cop dominates and completely owns the second half sheerly through his stone faced expressions, dialogues and action. While Dhananjaya as an antagonist largely dominates the screen space every time he comes on it. Every scene of the film gets loud cheer for the mass appeal provided.

The duel between Shivanna and Dhananjaya is a treat, then comes the Combination of Vasishta and Dhananjaya who complements equally and both acted dreadfully by entering the souls of their characters. Though the character of Vasishta as Chitte overshadowed by Dhananjaya’s Dolly but he still holds the ground and etches his visbility. Bhavana–Manvitha are apt, veteran Devaraj is under-utilized and the character Uncle is non-impactful.

The film completely banks on the screenplay, impactful dialogues, razor sharp editing, pulsating background score and soulful music.

On the flip side, some of the grey scenes could have been avoided, story could have been a little more tighter, road journey scenes could have been precise in the first half.

The tireless work of the Technical departments are visible, special mention for Mahendra Simha’s cinematography and Deepu S. Kumar’s editing; while Charanraj has become the new sensation through his music and background score.

Suri once again collaborated with Shivanna, after making a critically well claimed Kaddipudi, and he knew he not only had to surpass the previous expectations but also had to give bigger; thereby ends up gifting himself the biggest blockbuster of his directorial career.

He’s the only boy in his village who doesn’t own a pair of rain boots – and the other children tease him about it.

Given the ecologically compromised world we find ourselves in, can we learn to regard other, more open, systems of knowledge and being that strip humancentric perceptions of the world? E.g. How far can the computer determine or engineer biological design?

The artist, armed with the skill of rendering their surroundings with utmost acuity, was appointed to remove things from the realm of perception. Bambitchell’s ’Special Works School’ takes its name from this military unit to investigate the connections between artistic practice and surveillant technologies.

The arrival of cotton gave them the opportunity to become slave masters and wealthy plantation owners, but the Civil War left them embittered. Because of that, six Scottish-American former Confederate officers formed a fraternal society that became the oldest and most feared hate group in America: the Ku Klux Klan.  At the turn of the twentieth century, a racist novel by another Scots American became a bestseller, and the famous film based on it, The Birth of a Nation, revitalized the Klan. Now, well over 1,000 hate groups stalk America, including the League of the South, which advocates a separate Southern society run by ""Anglo Celts.""",0.6,/8MZUoJNbvWL5XaELi0khjVYyRkU.jpg,2/8/2018,0,58,Released,,Who Put the Klan in the Ku Klux Klan?,FALSE,0,0,"Documentary,",,,"en,",,0,,,1,3,"Ian Lilley,"
