Read the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2018/4/25/avengers-infinity-war.html,Amazing.  Visually stunning.  So much going on, but somehow also clear and easy to understand.  A little flabby in the middle third, but given the huge cast and story to cover it is very understandable.  The highlight was the parings of characters from different stories and their interactions.

If you aren't a Marvel fan this film won't convert you, but if you have liked any of the previous films you will like this too.

10/10,Just a very short, NO SPOILERS review I wanted to get down while it's still fresh.

For a movie with this much riding it, to come out not feeling disappointed, is a **massive** achievement. While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about _Infinity War_, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.

Personally? I can't wait to see it again. This is probably the most excited I've been about the second watch of an MCU film since the first _Avengers_.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._,The third act turns on a character being an idiot. That story beat renders all that the heroes do before and after it immaterial. That moment so preoccupied me that I couldn't enjoy the rest of the story, and made it impossible to ignore the flick's other glaring flaws anymore: the villain's motive makes no sense, the glove exists only to produce plot contrivances, the score is so obvious it might as well be cue cards on screen (""Feel sad now"") ...

The first half is some of the best action in a Disney Marvel entry yet, and the other half is so stupid that it sours the whole MCU experience.,Best MCU movie, more than that.... BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER. Hands Down,Nice Movie.,Massive, epic movie. I'm so happy that Marvel is stepping up their game with their villains. For too long, MCU villains have been too bland and generic. But lately, the villains have improved with Michael Keaton's Vulture, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and now James Brolin's Thanos. Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked. So bravo, Marvel!,Best Movie Ever...,***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***

RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.

The story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.

This is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is ""Iron Man 2"" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing ""Infinity War,"" as well as ""Black Panther"" (2018) and the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.

""Infinity War"" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. ""Rabbit."" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel ""Endgame.""

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.

GRADE: B-,I Love this movie.,It's the epitome of superhero trash and the franchise of manchildren.  The ultimate smashing your toys together to battle only this time it's for the world to see.,In 2012, Marvel Studios changed the cinematic landscape with a payoff that was five films in the making, proving a linked universe of movies could work.
In 2014, they proved to be one of the finest purveyors of entertainment by releasing two of the best genre films of all time back to back.
In 2018, Avengers: Infinity War is the culmination of ten years of narrative buildup. All the pieces were patiently put in place. The payoff? Never did my inner 8 year old think he would ever be watching a movie with Iron Man and Spider-Man sharing the same screen together, but here we are. Avengers: Infinity War is a very fine piece of 'turn your brain off' storytelling, except it actually goes the extra mile to have some intelligence.

We all know the film isn't the Endgame, but we're primed and ready for Part 2. Shut up and take my 💰 Marvel!,One of the best Marvel Movies!,Josh Brolin portrayed Thanos really beautiful. He was an amazing villain that kept all the Avengers on their edge and made them think it was a bit hopeless to really go against him.,This is a blast of a Marvel movie and I can't wait to see what will happen next. You are clueless and you don’t know what will happen, keeping us all on the edge of our seats. Fascinating!,Here we are 10 years later with one of the most anticipated movies of all time! The CGI was much better, the story was better...everything about the Infinity War was great!,It is unlike anything ever done in the history of cinema. This one is masterfully woven from the culmination of Marvel movies throughout the years. Truly amazing!,The character development for Thanos was so good that it made me think that maybe he was right. He was the villain that surpassed all the other villains from the past Marvel movies. Trust me, this is the movie that might have changed the MCU.,GOOSEBUMPS! Infinity War is worth watching. The usual comedic banter between the casts, the awesome CGI, amazing plotline, the results did not disappoint.,Avengers: Infinity War was clearly much better than Avengers: Endgame in the sense that 1) it was better in terms of writing, 2) it is the true culmination of an entire decade of MCU films, and 3) Endgame gave me more questions than answers.,","magic,sacrifice,superhero,based on comic,space,battlefield,genocide,magical object,super power,team,aftercreditsstinger,marvel cinematic universe,cosmic,",65,580,"Joe Russo,"

It was actually really good the kids loved it and the story line was quite good. Give it a look you won't be disappointed.,Takes some pretty massive but almost certainly necessary departures from the original source material. There's nothing about _Rampage_ to dislike in any particular abundance, except maybe the over-reliance on cliché, but there's also nothing much that stands out positively. The Rock is charming as ever, and the creature designs are so-so, but really this was just the sort of movie you sit back and let happen, you can hope to walk away a little entertained, but certainly not enriched.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._,This movie is following the usual recipe for these kind of movies. Big companies are bad, gene science is bad, big monsters are cool. The story is fairly ludicrous, science non-existent and almost everyone except the hero is a dumb-ass.

Regardless of all that, I quite enjoyed this movie. I watched it with the expectation of seeing The Rock and huge monsters wreck things and that is exactly what I got. The story itself is weak and the science is, well ludicrous. How these monsters grows to immense sizes in almost no time at all defies science of course. But heck, who want’s to spend time in a action movie watching animals grow? Also, what a strange coincidence that the ape, who happens to be on the good side, is the only one of them that doesn’t grow huge fangs, horns or other horrific appendages. As I said, the story is nonsense.

However, once the action starts it is the usual wreck everything overkill kind of action that which is one of the few things that Hollywood is really good at these times. I really enjoyed it even if it was, at times, very very silly. And then we have The Rock. I really like The Rock. Call me old-fashioned but I do like macho type heroes with silly one-liners.

As usual the military trying to fight the monsters are depicted, pretty much, as morons. Uberconfident in their capacity to stop the monsters. The monsters of course proves them wrong. So what to do then? Well just nuke them. Okay, they didn’t try to use actual nukes but dropping a MOAB on the downtown of a major city is not that far from using nukes. I mean, come on, they claimed to have evacuated the city in what? A few hours. Not happening. Also in the fighting before this dumb-ass decision they send in a Warthog which was a fairly logical decision at least but they send in a single one! What the f…? And do not get me started about these creatures just shrugging of a Warthog. These planes are tank-killers for Christ sake. Oh well, here I go about science again.

Bad guys. Gotta have bad guys (well apart from the monsters of course) don’t we? Well, Claire Wyden is not too bad. The stereotypical big company asshole not caring about anything than her personal gains. However, Brett Wyden is just annoying. He’s stupid, stupid, stupid and just overly childish. Did I say stupid? From the first scene that he was in I rooted for him to get eaten by his sister’s creations. He wasn’t eaten actually but his demise was fairly satisfactory nonetheless.

Despite all of this I did, as I wrote earlier, enjoy the movie. It was exactly what I hoped it would be. A roller-coaster ride of action and mayhem. The Rock was great. His “side-kick” Dr. Caldwell was okay but fairly forgettable. Agent Russell however went from annoying government agent to one of my favorite characters in the course of the movie. The scene where he stops that dumb-ass Brett Wayden and then lets him walk away towards his well deserved destiny quite enjoyable.

I did like the ape as well. I liked how he made jokes on The Rock. An ape giving The Rock the finger may sound silly but it was actually quite funny.

Bottom line, two hours of good entertainment providing that monsters on rampage is your kind of movie.,","gorilla,monster,wolf,mutation,lizard,giant lizard,based on video game,giant animal,mutant animal,kaiju,albino,giant,rat,genetic experiment,destroyed city,giant gorilla,animal monster,",69,180,"Brad Peyton,"

So let’s First get this out of The way I’ve never been more frustrated, by people eating popcorn, fidgeting, & Coming in late. 

Anyways form the very start I had so many questions, how’d they get here? Where’d the Monster come from? Etc. And by the end I have no answers and even more questions. Are they gonna survive and kill all the Monsters? Is everyone else dead? Why’d they think to have a baby? But that doesn’t matter.

We’re just tossed into this situation with no explanation to almost anything. The only things we really know is of course making lond sounds means you’re likely gonna die. And High Pitch Sounds Hurts the Monster. 

Wish is a smart Choice and come to think of it is kinda obvious, maybe a little too obvious. Like how’d they never think about that? Either way. 

A quick note for surviving other then the soundproofing here and there. Why not have a sound bomb of sorts, you could just throw? That would have toldy saved the Dad from having to sacrifice him self. 

That isn’t to say they’re stupid they had many Smart decisions such a The sand paths, the box for the baby (wish was kinda sad), the little sound proof room, the Radio, and the fireworks. And that’s just the sound related stuff the Lights and Fires Where also Smart.

Otherwise the cast give us some incredible performances and lots of good chemistry. It probably helps that John and Emily are a real couple. Speaking of wich John Krasinski has Written and Directed a very clever and suspenseful horror film. I’ve never been more scared of corn in my life. Also had jumped at water. 

And the sound department specifically the Foley Artist have never shined greater in any film I have ever seen before. The sound is a way flipped from most horror films as it’s when the music drops and everything goes quiet that the Monster attacks. But not in this case everytime the Monster comes it’s a big moment.

Although I have nothing against a R rating. In fact I’m somethimes more likely to see a film because of a R rating, it shows they have gus and they are willing to take a risk. F*ck you MPAA!!! 

Anyways some times all kinds of unnecessary crap is put in a Film because they like oh yeah we’re rated R. Although that’s not always needed this Film proves a well done PG-13 can still be dark and brutal. Killing a Child with in the first 10ish minuets, is a little dark. Although come on that kid had it Coming as soon as he grab those batteries. there’s almost a bit of blood maybe the MPAA is pulling back on some things. Probably not those F*ck you MPAA!!!

Ok sorry my review is getting to become rated R. 😆

Also I wanted to note for whatever reason I enjoy films where I can count the entire cast.

Along side Get Out it seems people form comedy make better Horror film Directors then most Horror film Directors. It definitely makes sense though it’s all about that timing.


In Short It was a gripping film from start to finish. I’d highly recommend to all Horror and Thriller Fans. Although because of spoilers in this review you probably already saw it. 


So leave a comment and let’s discuss.

No likes,**_No important spoilers here_**

In a **dystopic future**, the humanity has been severely smitten by strange blind creatures that feast on living flesh, both human and animal. In spite of being blind, the creatures have a super hearing and can identify sounds from far away. The creatures are nearly indestructible and very effective killers, and once they hear you, you are most likely dead.

The movie follows a surviving family trying to keep alive in this harsh reality. The movie setup is incredibly well-built to transpire the precaution, the constant fear, and the direful consequences of an unthought action in this terrible future. **The sound effects are awesome**, and the director can successfully use the nearly-constant silence in contrast to the hassle of being followed by those creatures.

The **acting is solid** and helps to immerse the watcher in the well-built plot.

My only regret for this movie is that it ends during a climax, when we are not ready to stop watching it yet. **It could be 30 minutes longer** to explain some missing points and to show what happens after the ending.

Overall, **an awesome movie**, well-thought and beautifully produced in every aspect.,Every time a horror movie does something that I've never seen before, that gets me very excited. _A Quiet Place_ is such a movie. I do believe that maybe _A Quiet Place_ doesn't **quite** deserve the praise that it has received. Not that it isn't a good movie, just that said acclaims have been **so** high, to the point that I think maybe just the fact that it's original isn't enough to earn those laurels.

I still am a fan of the movie, hardline, absolutely, just maybe a little underwhelmed given the reviews.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._,This is far and away one of the best movies I have ever watched, and I've watched a lot of movies!  The story is original, no  small feat these days, and the acting is just outstanding!  John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the children, bring these characters to life, and make us really care, all without the benefit of well written dialogue.  That's not easy to do, but they do it.  Right from the start, you find yourself drawn into the lives of these people, and can feel the tension, the undercurrent of threat, that they live with every day.  Through all they face, we are also given a picture of a solid family, with a dad and mom doing everything possible to care for their children, the family praying together, holding onto faith even under the most difficult of circumstances, and that family dynamic really strengthens the entire story.  Who do you rely on when all is changed?  When everything goes wrong?  Family.  Along with the acting, the direction, sets, just everything, come together to deliver a truly scary movie, that doesn't rely on flash to terrify you.  Highly recommend this one.  We saw it in the theater, and bought it as soon as it hit the stores.  Top notch work.,This film is terrible. How this pathetic excuse for entertainment has any rating is a mystery. It's an insult to art of film making and to the people who love cinema. Nobody in their right mind would suggest watching this hole ridden, ham acted, utter nonsense themed non-story movie to anybody. Save yourself the hassle, trust me, it's bad.,_**Decent horror flick, but the family members make too many exasperating blunders**_

A family tries to survive on their farm in rural New York while blind indestructible creatures prowl the landscape. The creatures find prey based on sound so they have to be careful to be quiet at all times. Emily Blunt plays the pregnant mother and John Krasinski her husband (Krasinski also directs).  

“A Quiet Place” (2018) is a well-made horror flick that brings to mind “Signs” (2002) with ferocious creatures that mix the xenomorphs of “Alien/Aliens” with the extraterrestrials of “War of the Worlds” (2005). They’re basically a knock-off of the monster in “Cloverfield” (2008), albeit the smaller size of the creatures in those previous flicks.

While this movie gets a lot of praise in some circles, the constant mistakes of the family members gets frustrating and tiresome. I love the tone, however, as well as Emily Blunt and the sumptuous Hudson River-area locations.     

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in the state of New York, about 50-65 miles north of the Big Apple (Beacon, Pawling & New Paltz), except for Little Falls, which is another 110 miles northwest.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._,Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

Trigger warning: This does have some aspects of kidnapping, and sexual assault.

Bel Powley is amazing, and really carries the movie.  Liv Tyler does a great caring mother role, Brad Dourif is sufficiently creepy, and Collin Kelly-Sordelet is an angsty teen, but James Le Gros is more interesting than they are without saying much at all.  The support characters are here more to facilitate the mechanics of the story, and its not that the story is poorly written, it is just focused.

The establishing act is brutal because we know what is happening to her, and everything past that is centered on her transformation, and presented amazingly.

This is a very visually focused movie, and while the dialogue is not poorly written by any means, there just isn't much clever to it.  I honestly think this is still as great movie if you put it on mute and give it a watch.,","hunter,sheriff,transformation,forest,menstruation,horror,murder,werewolf,captive,northern lights,",24,101,"Fritz Böhm,"

The movie had some strange editing choices. It’s unintentionally funny but not a movie thats so bad its fun. To give you a quick spoiler free review it’s about a valet who tries to rob David Tennant’s place. When he is about to leave he sees a woman tied up. The rest of the movie is him trying to notify the police but it becomes a “Cat and Mouse” game between the valet and David Tennant. But increasingly gets silly and overall the stuff that is supposed to be scary or intense falls flat or is just funny.

- Andrew Haigh; ""_Lean On Pete_: In Conversation With Filmmaker Andrew Haigh""; _Candid_ (May 5, 2018)

15-year-old Charley Thompson (Charlie Plummer) lives with his father, Ray (Travis Fimmel), who is drinking himself into an early grave. Finding work caring for an ageing racehorse named Lean on Pete, Charley is devastated when he learns that Pete's owner, Del Montgomery (Steve Buscemi), is planning to slaughter the animal. Determined to save his friend, Charley steals Pete, and the two set out on an odyssey across the modern American frontier.

Fans of writer/director Andrew Haigh will know his unassailable talent for what one might label unsentimental emotionalism; his films deal with intensely emotional situations without lapsing into Speilbergian fawnishness. And, although compared to the excellent _Weekend_ (2011), and the masterful _45 Years_ (2015), _Lean on Pete_ is a touch melodramatic, Haigh's talent for allowing character and theme to rise organically to the surface through quiet moments of introspection is still very much to the fore. So why not a higher score? Adapted from Willy Vlautin's 2010 novel of the same name, the biggest problem with the film is that things are laid on too thick; Charley is very much a Job figure, and suffers such a litany of misfortunes that one fully expects him to be diagnosed with terminal cancer. Similarly, the pseudo-allegorical nature of the characters he encounters is too on-the-nose for the realistic _milieu_ Haigh has crafted. Part state-of-the-nation address, part _bildungsroman_, it's worth a look, but is ultimately lacking a satisfying thematic through-line.,","horse race,runaway,portland, oregon,horse,racehorse,drunk,trophy,road movie,bildungsroman,",29,78,"Andrew Haigh,"

>_André was a superstar. He was the biggest and the greatest superstar this business has ever known, and ever will know. He was André the Giant; he was the one that laid the groundwork for Hulk Hogan, for Stone Cold Steve Austin, for The Rock, for anybody else that walks through the doors of the WWE Universe. It wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for André. And to know him as a superstar and a giant, I remember when I was a fan I used to watch him, and he would put his hand on the top rope and step over, when he was in his p__rime, and I was looking at his leg hanging off the ring, it looked like a Clydesdale. He was bigger than anyone I'd ever seen and I never imagined I'd be friends with him or I'd get to meet him. Fast forward to him being the greatest of all time, as a person, what he went through, I would walk behind him in the airport, and I would hear, ""did you see that guy"" and very unkind things. And he could hear them, so for him to walk through and be as kind of a person as he was and as gentle a person, because if he'd have been a mean person, there would have been none of us around. Talk about the guy that never got pinned, that would have been the guy. Nobody could have done anything to him. But to know him as a person, and to know, if you could imagine, a little Barbie doll house, every chair he sat in, every bed he tried to lay in, for André to take up a normal fork, it was like a toothpick in his hand. Yet this man had so much compassion, but he could never be comfortable. I'd sit in first class, behind him, and the way the storage bins go up, his head would be tilted. And that was in first class. So he'd have to fly with his head cocked sideways; 14 hours from Kennedy to Japan, and he can't fit in the bathroom, for 14 hours. So to get the whole 360 of what his life was all about, and become that good friends with him, hear what was said about him, how he reacted, he was a very gracious and very kind person. There'll never be another André._

- Hulk Hogan; ""Hulk Hogan Reflects on André the Giant""; _WrestleMania Rewind Extra_ (March 4, 2014)

I'm currently 41 years old and my birthday is in July, so on March 29, 1987, I was 8. That night, the most significant pro-wrestling match of all time took place, and I was the perfect age to absorb it – old enough to appreciate the spectacle, not so old as to be aware of the predetermined nature of the matches. And so, at _WrestleMania III_ in the Pontiac Silverdome, in front of 93,173 fans and millions watching around the world, Hulk Hogan (the greatest of all time then and the greatest of all time now) defended his world heavyweight title against his former best friend, André the Giant. The build to the show was a perfect example of how good World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) used to be at promoting themselves, prior to the internet laying bare the business and the horrific stagnation that is their current product. Indeed, Hogan/André was built upon a litany of falsehoods, but falsehoods designed to sell the match as something wholly unique – André was billed as 7ft 4in (he was actually around 7ft), weighing 520lbs (strangely, he was actually heavier than billed, over 600lbs), a man who had never been beaten (he had), a man who had never been knocked off his feet (he had), and a man who had never faced Hogan before (he had, many times). The whole thing was a perfect storm of an expanding and rabid fan base, a company that had gone from territorial to national to international in just a few years, advertising acumen, talent with charisma to burn, and, most importantly, genuine emotion – Hogan had been betrayed by his oldest and closest friend, a man who had grown bitter and resentful of Hogan's success, and who had allied with one of wrestling's biggest heels (bad guys), Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, with the sole intention of taking Hogan's title from him, a title he had held since January 1984. Of course, by 1987, Hulkamania was well on its way to becoming the biggest thing the business had ever seen, and the match was conceived to push Hogan even further. It's not the greatest contest of all time; for a _WrestleMania_ main event, it's very short (12 minutes), with Hogan extremely restricted as to what he could do with André, whose mobility was severely compromised and who was in immense pain due to the effects of acromegaly. But it didn't matter, because the match culminated with Hogan doing the impossible and slamming André, something that was billed as having never happened before (it had, although at a time when André weighed considerably less). It's rare in pro-wrestling when a babyface (good guy) champion goes into a match as the underdog, but that was exactly what had happened here, making Hogan's victory all the more significant.

Which brings us to Jason Hehir's excellent documentary on André for HBO, the emotional high-point of which is the _WrestleMania III_ match. Sure, it's not always successful in its attempts to separate the man from the myth, falling back far too often on the very hyperbolic mythological elements it's trying to sidestep, it's neither as insightful nor as objective as one might wish - it was made in association with WWE, which makes objectivity pretty much impossible - and there's next to nothing here you couldn't find online. However, it's respectful, informed, and entertaining, avoiding, for the most part, hagiography, and featuring some superb archival footage, providing a not-always-uplifting window into the life of a man for whom the term ""gentle giant"" could very well have been coined.

André René Roussimoff was born in 1946 in Molien, France. At first, he was a normal size, but from the age of around 10, he began to display signs of gigantism (a condition where the pituitary gland secretes too much growth hormone), and by age 12, he was already 6ft 3in and 208lbs. Hoping for a career in rugby, in 1964, he began to attend a gym frequented by several professional wrestlers, who taught him how to wrestle. One particular night, a wrestler was injured, and André was brought in to replace him, leading to him wrestling full-time. With a backstory that he was a lumberjack from the French Alps who had been discovered by hikers, he wrestled for various French promotions under names such as Géant Ferré and Jean Ferré. Quickly proving he could draw, he worked for promotions in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Japan (where he wrestled as Monster Roussimoff). In the US at the time, wrestling was territorial – each geographical region had its own local promotion, with wrestlers moving from territory to territory, although most promotions tended to have a few core wrestlers who didn't work elsewhere. The biggest and most lucrative promotion was Vincent J. McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), which operated in the Northeast, and was the only promotion with access to Madison Square Garden, a mecca for pro-wrestling then as now. In 1973, McMahon contracted André, and to prevent him becoming stale due to overexposure, he would loan him out to promotions all over the world. In 1982, McMahon sold the renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to his son Vince, who set about creating a national promotion, one which would travel all over the country and whose programming would air on national cable as opposed to regional stations. In 1984, McMahon hired André as a WWF exclusive, leading to feuds with wrestlers such as Killer Khan, Big John Studd, and King Kong Bundy. By the time of the original _WrestleMania_ in 1985, the WWF was very much a national organisation, and McMahon had his sights set on the international market. Spearheading this bid for global dominance was Terry Gene Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan). However, by 1987, with _WrestleMania III_ on the horizon, Hogan had feuded with and defeated virtually every heel in the locker room. By this stage, André's gigantism had developed into acromegaly, as he continued to grow, putting huge pressure on his joints, which caused him constant pain. Semi-retired, he had trouble even walking. However, McMahon pitched a storyline which would see André turn heel for the first time in his career (this claim was actually true) and challenge Hogan for the title. The resulting match was instantly iconic, not just in the pro-wrestling sphere, but in pop culture generally. That same year, André appeared in Rob Reiner's _The Princess Bride_, playing Fezzik, a gentle giant with a penchant for rhyming. Refusing all treatment for his acromegaly as he felt it would interfere with his career and diminish his persona, he continued to wrestle on and off for the next five years, as his health continued to decline. He died in his sleep of congestive heart failure on January 27, 1993. He was 46 years old.

Covering his biography, the documentary hits most of the beats you'd expect – his time as Géant Ferré in France and Monster Roussimoff in Japan; the territorial system; the way rumours would spread from one territory to another, building his mystique; his legendary drinking (his minimum was 24 beers, whilst ""The Nature Boy"" Ric Flair once saw him drink 106); his immense popularity with women; how uncomfortable his life was (for example, he couldn't fit in an airplane toilet and so would have to go in a bucket behind a curtain); his sensitivity when he'd hear people talking unkindly about his size; his purchase of a ranch in Ellerbe, NC; the arrival of cable and the expansion of the WWF; his refusal of all medical aid for his acromegaly; the rise of Hulk Hogan; _WrestleMania III_; _The Princess Bride_; his great friendship with WWF referee Tim White; and his death in a Parisian hotel.

Interviewees include Antoine and Jacques Roussimoff (André's brothers), Pat Laprade and David Shoemaker (wrestling historians), ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund (WWE announcer), Vince McMahon (WWE owner), Shane McMahon (Vince's son), Terry Todd (sports journalist and former power lifter), Dave Meltzer (wrestling journalist), Tim White (former WWE referee and André's closest friend), Robin Christopher (André's daughter), actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, and Billy Crystal, director Rob Reiner, and former WWE wrestlers Hulk Hogan, Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, Ric Flair, and Pat Patterson. An important point to make at this juncture is that if you're not a fan of Hulk Hogan, you probably won't be a fan of the documentary. Like it or not, André's legacy is tied up in Hogan's, so it makes sense that he's the most pervasive interviewee and that the climax of the film is built around their _WrestleMania III_ match (they also fought at _WrestleMania IV_ (and Hogan slammed André again), but the importance of that match is negligible). Indeed, for a ten-minute segment about three-quarters of the way through, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a documentary about Hogan, not André, with the Hulkster becoming the central figure as Hehir focuses on the global expansion of the WWF.

The film is composed entirely of archival footage and talking-head interviews, with Hehir choosing not to employ a narrator, effectively allowing the interviewees to tell the story. During pre-production, Hehir and producer Bill Simmons decided to include only material which had been directly witnessed; there was to be nothing anecdotal. As Hehir explains it, ""_we were only going to have first-person accounts. So, if someone said, ""I heard André drank 156 beers,"" well, were you there? If you weren't, it's not gonna make it in. But when Ric Flair says ""he drank 106 beers in front of me_"", that makes it in."" This is a wise choice as it affords the documentary a sense of personalised intimacy – every interviewee is talking about things they actually saw rather than things about which they heard – which, in turn, works towards Hehir's mission statement of depicting the man rather than the myth. As he explains it, ""_there's so much mythology about him and yet, there's a lack of journalism about him. There are great graphic novels that have been made, and really entertaining stuff that's been written, but it's not like a, quote-unquote, ""real sport,"" where there's actual documentation and deep dives into this guy's life._""

In this respect, one of the most important sections in the film is the disappointingly brief depiction of his time in his adopted home of Ellerbe. Interviewing his daughter, who spent time with him on his ranch, and a few neighbours, this is where Hehir is most successful in dividing the man from the mythos. André loved living there because he could be himself and because he was left alone – he could go to the shop without people gawking at him or asking for autographs, he could be a regular citizen. This comes in the middle of a section about how logistically difficult André's life was (as Flair points out, he couldn't put on a disguise and stroll around New York or go to a movie, and as Hogan explains, everything was too small for him, rendering mundane tasks such as eating in a restaurant hugely difficult). The Ellerbe material really gives the impression that, outside his native France, this was where he was happiest. It's one of the most low-key, moving, and human parts of the documentary, giving us an impression of the man that syncs with his colleagues' assertion that he was a gentle and unassuming soul, and it's the only part of the film where hyperbole seems entirely absent. 

Another rather moving section concerns the making of _The Princess Bride_. Anyone familiar with the film will already know everything covered in this section, but many wrestling fans will not. In a direct rejoinder to colleagues who humorously extol his legendary drinking, Elwes points out that the reason André drank so much was that he was perpetually in so much pain. Along the same lines, Reiner and Wright discuss how surprised they were at how difficult André found it to perform even the simplest physical tasks. There's the famous shot, for example, where Westley (Elwes) jumps on Fezzik's back, and Fezzik slams them both into a boulder, a scene which employs one of the most obvious stunt doubles ever seen, as André was unable to shoot the scene himself. Even more revealing is the scene where he catches Buttercup (Wright) as she falls from a tower, a scene which had to be shot with Wright supported on wires because André couldn't hold her weight. This man who routinely tossed 300lb opponents around the ring couldn't support the weight of a single woman.

In this sense, although the tone is never melancholy, André's story does emerge as something of a tragedy – not because he failed to achieve his dreams, but because in doing so, he dissuaded himself from availing of the aid that could have lengthened his life, and would certainly have eased his suffering.

In terms of problems, the most egregious is Hehir's failure (for the most part) to disentangle André Roussimoff from André the Giant. Hogan, Flair, White, McMahon, and others all talk about the man behind the persona, but none of them can claim to have known him before he became André the Giant. This is why the Ellerbe section, and the brief material on his life in France, which bookends the main narrative, is so important, as it speaks to who he actually was rather than who we believe him to be. So although Hehir does avoid hagiography, he fails to demythologise, with so many of the (probably hyperbolic) stories told by the interviewees fitting more comfortably into the image of André the Giant than the life of André Roussimoff. Additionally, more than likely due to the WWE's direct involvement with the project, there's nothing even remotely negative said about the company, although Hogan does point out that, come _WrestleMania III_, André probably shouldn't have been in the ring. The implication is that McMahon may have exploited André's passion for the business, but this fascinating theme is buried under more mythologising and is quickly forgotten. There's certainly a documentary to be made about André's later years, about his inability to leave the spotlight, about his lack of interest in self-preservation, but this is not that documentary.

Nevertheless, this is a very fine tribute. André was vitally important to an industry at a pivotal crossroads, and the film captures why he was such a compelling character, eliciting pathos (and later antagonism) from wrestling audiences the world over with relative ease.,","biography,wrestling,pro wrestling,",38,13,"Jason Hehir,"

_Transit_ is based on Anna Segher's 1944 novel of the same name about a German concentration camp survivor seeking passage from Vichy Marseilles to North Africa in 1940, as the Nazis move ever closer to the city. However, rather than a 1:1 adaptation, the film is built upon a fascinating structural conceit – although it tells the same story as Segher's novel, it is set in the here and now. At least, some elements are set in the here and now. In fact, only part of the film's _milieu_ is modern. So, although such things as cars, ships, weaponry, and police uniforms are all contemporary, there are no mobile phones, no computers, people still use typewriters and send letters, and the clothes worn by the characters are the same as would have been worn at the time. Think of it this way – we've all seen modern dress productions of Shakespeare (from Barry Jackson's introduction of the concept in the 1923 Birmingham Reparatory Theatre production of _Cymbeline_ to Orson Welles's 1937 Mercury Theatre production of _Julius Caesar_, on up to films such as Richard Loncraine's 1995 adaptation of _Richard III_ and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 adaptation of _Romeo and Juliet_). So it would be like a Shakespeare production in which everyone is wearing modern dress, but they're still fighting with swords. In essence, what this means is that the film is set neither entirely in 1940 nor entirely in 2019, but in a strange kind of temporal halfway-house, borrowing elements from each. 

There's a fairly obvious reason that writer/director Christian Petzold (_Yella_; _Barbara_; _Phoenix_) employs this strategy, and it has to be said, it works exceptionally well, with the film's thematic focus symbiotically intertwined with its aesthetic to a highly unusual degree. In this sense, although the film ostensibly tells a story about 1940s Europe, its focus on refugees and its pseudo-modern setting mean that it also acts as something of a ""state of the nation"" address for Europe in 2019. In particular, it speculates as to what could happen in the not too distant future, given the rise of militant anti-immigration rhetoric and neo-fascist political ideology. The film doesn't so much suggest that history is repeating itself, as postulate that there's no historical difference between then and now. Unfortunately, aside from this daring aesthetic gambit, not much else worked for me, with the plot painfully somnolent and the characters void of virtually any relatable emotion.

The film begins in Paris, as Georg (Franz Rogowski) is entrusted with delivering some papers to George Weidel, a famous communist author currently in the city. After narrowly avoiding arrest, Georg makes his way to Weidel's hotel room but finds the writer has committed suicide. Taking an unpublished manuscript, two letters from Weidel to his wife Marie, and Weidel's transit visa for passage to Mexico, Georg and his companion Heinz (Ronald Kukulies) stowaway on a train heading for Marseilles, one of the few European ports not yet under the control of the ""fascists"", and where the hotels will only accept guests who can prove they will soon be leaving (i.e. people who already have transit visas for passage to another country). _En route_, Heinz dies from an infection, and upon arriving in Marseilles, Georg visits Heinz's Moroccan wife, Melissa (Maryam Zaree), to break the news. However, when he discovers that she's deaf, he has to explain Heinz's death through her young son, Driss (Lilien Batman), with whom he quickly forms a bond. Meanwhile, he heads to the Mexican consulate intending to return Weidel's belongings in the hopes they may get to his wife. However, when he is mistaken for Weidel himself, he realises he has a chance to escape Europe, with Weidel booked on a ship sailing in a few days. As Georg awaits passage, he has several encounters with a mysterious woman, who, it is soon revealed is none other than Marie Weidel (Paula Beer), who is waiting for word from her husband. Not telling her that Weidel is dead, Georg finds himself falling for her, and begins to contemplate the new life he believes they can make together. However, things become more complicated when Driss takes ill and is tended to by local doctor, Richard (Godehard Giese), himself a refugee who is currently in a relationship with Marie and is desperate to flee with her so as to begin work in a children's hospital in Mexico. Weidel's transit visa, however, is for only two people.

With a _milieu_ that is authentic to neither the 1940s nor the 2010s, _Transit_ is _Casablanca_ filtered through Franz Kafka; it's what you might imagine if Sam (Dooley Wilson) played a polyphonic synthesizer, but Rick Blain (Humphrey Bogart) was still a Spanish Civil War veteran. Shot on location in Paris and Marseilles, everything from street signs to cars (including a few electric ones) to the front of buildings is modern, whilst Hans Fromm's crisp digital photography hasn't been aged in any way whatsoever (people who had a problem with Michael Mann shooting _Public Enemies_ (2009) on digital will be especially unimpressed). 

In terms of cultural signifiers, Petzold keeps it fairly vague, although there is a reference to, of all things, George A. Romero's _Dawn of the Dead_ (1978), whilst the closing credits are scored by Talking Heads' ""Road to Nowhere"" (1982). Aside from that, Petzold avoids the minefield of choosing which cultural artefacts to include and which to leave out. However, for everything that seems to locate the film in the 21st century, there's something which seems to locate it in the 1940s, whether it be the absence of mobile phones, computers, and the internet, the ubiquity of typewriters and letters, or the clothes worn by the characters (except the police, who are dressed in modern riot gear). Along the same lines, Petzold keeps the politics generalised, with no mention of Nazis, concentration camps, or the Holocaust (indeed, it is never fully established why Georg himself is fleeing, although one assumes it's because he's a Jew). Instead of these specifics, the film makes references to archetypal ""fascists"", never-defined ""camps"", and systemic ""cleansing"". As an aside, the fact that so many of the refugees are trying to reach Mexico carries its own political undercurrent, with Mexican immigration to the US such a hot-button topic at the moment. In this sense, the film's racially motivated raids, importance of documentation, and inhumane detention conditions allude to 2019 as much as they recall 1940.

The combination of liminal elements of modernity and period-specific history sets up a temporal/cognitive dissonance which places the narrative somewhere between fact and allegory, as if it were inverted magic realism. This, in effect, forces the audience to move beyond the abstract notion that what once happened could happen again. Instead, we are made to recognise that the difference between past and present is an unimportant semantic distinction only, and that that which once happened never really stopped happening; political displacement today is, for all intents and purposes, just as it was in 1940. Indeed, given the resurgence of Neo-Fascism across Europe, built primarily on irrational xenophobic fears of the Other in the form of immigration, the refugee crisis could very well become a global crisis (some would argue it already is), with Transit attempting to serve as a wake-up call. Along the same lines, the film's temporal dislocation suggests both the specificity and the universality of the refugee experience – every refugee is fundamentally unique, but so too is the experience the same, irrespective of when or where it happens. The important point here is that Petzold was able to lift a story from 1940 and place it in a relatively modern _milieu_ without changing much. The fact that conditions in 1940 can so easily slot into 2019 speaks to his central theme – nothing has changed for refugees.

The other important aesthetic choice is the use of a very unusual voiceover narration. Introduced out of the blue as Georg begins reading Weidel's manuscript at around the 20-minute mark, there's no initial indication as to the narrator's identity or when the narration is taking place. Additionally, the narrator is unreliable, as on occasion he describes something differently to how we see it. At the same time, the voice seems to alternate between omniscience and rigid subjectivity; at times, he speaks about something beyond Georg's perception (Georg is the focaliser throughout the entire film), at other times he describes Georg's innermost thoughts. The narration also ""interacts"" with the dialogue at one point – in a scene between Georg and Marie, their dialogue alternates with the VO; they get one part of a sentence and the VO completes it, or vice versa.

However, although I really liked the temporal dissonance, the experimental VO didn't work nearly as well, serving primarily to smother the characters. The sudden introduction and the alternating range of the narrator's perceptions serves only to pull you out of the film as you try to answer a myriad of questions - where and when is the voice is coming from; what is its relationship to the narrative; are we hearing a character speak or someone outside the _fabula_; how can the narrator have access to Georg's innermost thoughts at some points but not at others; why is the voice able to accurately describe things not seen by Georg, but often inaccurately describe things which are; why does the narration seem to be ahead of the narrative at some points, behind it at others; what is the purpose of the pseudo-break of the fourth wall by having the VO alternate with dialogue? I certainly don't have answers to all of these questions, but I think the point of the destabilising/defamiliarising narration is to reinforce the importance of storytelling – the experience of being a refugee is not lineal or ordered, but a mass of stories within stories and fragments that often contradict one another.

Thematically, Petzold has always been interested in issues of identity, political disenfranchisement, people desperate to leave somewhere, and ghosts (sometimes literal, sometimes existential), and _Transit_ is no exception. Weidel figuratively haunts the entire narrative, whilst Georg and the refugees, in general, exist as pseudo-ghosts, haunting Marseille until they can leave. However, this focus on ghosts also highlights several of the film's failings.

To suggest the disenfranchised nature of what it is to be a refugee, Petzold depicts Georg as essentially a non-person; he has very little agency of his own and is instead someone to whom things happen. In short, he's passive, less a protagonist than a witness. Passive characters can work extremely well in the right circumstances (think of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in the first act of George Lucas's _Star Wars_, Chance Gardner (Peter Sellers) in Hal Ashby's _Being There_, or the most famous example, Hamlet), but here, passivity combines with a dearth of backstory and character development, whilst Rogowski plays the part without a hint of interiority. In essence, we see Georg wandering around Marseille a lot...like really a lot. And we don't see him doing a huge amount else. Easily the most successful scenes in the film are those showing his friendship with Driss because they're the only moments where he seems like a person rather than a narrative construct, they're the only parts of the film that ring emotionally true.

That this is so is a serious problem, as the friendship is very much a subplot, and is secondary to the love story between Georg and Marie. Except that it isn't a love story; there's no emotional realism to it whatsoever, with the two characters becoming involved for no reason other than it said they had to in the script. I do understand what Petzold is going for here. He doesn't want a Hollywood love story of fireworks and poetic monologues, he wants to show that the war and their status as refugees has stripped them of their identities, and they are now effectively shells. However, this in no way necessitates such a badly written relationship void of any and all emotional truth.

What Petzold is trying to do in his characterisation of Georg is clear enough; as an archetypal refugee, Georg can't be seen to have much control over his affairs as that would betray the actual experiences of real refugees. In this sense, his time in Marseille _must_ be static, an existence in-between more fully realised states. Petzold uses this to try to imply that to be divested of one's country is to be divested of one's identity. So, my criticism that Georg is a non-person is very much built into the film's DNA. Am I criticising the film for doing what it set out to do, and for doing it exceptionally well? Not really. I understand that Georg must be passive. However, the extent of his passivity renders him completely unrealistic – he's not a person, he's a robot, and the Georg at the end of the film is the same character as he is at the start.

Tied to this is the lack of forward narrative momentum. Again, I understand that Petzold is trying to stay true to the experience, that the life of a refugee in a place like Marseille in 1940 must necessarily involve a lot of waiting, a lot of repetition, and a lot of frustration. But again, it's the extent to which the film goes to suggest this, with entire sections going by without anything resembling a dramatic event. Yes, inertia is part of the theme insofar as the film depicts people suffering from crippling inertia, but it doesn't necessarily follow that the film needs to be so unrelentingly dull and uneventful.

Easily the most egregious problem is one that arises from a combination of these issues – it's impossible to care about any of the characters. Think of films as varied as Markus Imhoof's _Das Boot ist voll_ (1980), Terry George's _Hotel Rwanda_ (2004), or Aki Kaurismäki's _Le Havre_ (2011) and _Toivon tuolla puolen_ (2017). All depict refugees from various conflicts at various stages of their journeys, and all ring true emotionally, because they are populated by characters about whom we come to care. This is precisely what _Transit_ is lacking. There is simply no pathos, with none of the characters coming across as anything but a cipher, a representative archetype onto which Petzold can project his thematic concerns. With little in the way of psychological verisimilitude or interiority, they simply never come alive as real people.

An intellectual film rather than an emotional one, _Transit_ is cold and distant and has a hugely unimportant and out-of-place voiceover narration (although to be fair, the VO is the only thing which allows us access to Georg's feelings). And this coldness and distance has a cumulative effect, with the film eventually outlasting my patience. The temporal dissonance works extremely well, but it's really all the film has going for it. Petzold says some interesting things regarding the experience of refugees in the 21st century _vis-à-vis_ refugees of World War II, and the mirror he holds up to our society, showing us how such people are treated, isn't especially flattering. If only we could care about someone on screen. Anyone.,","marseille, france,identity,",15,13,"Christian Petzold,"

""  Hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, and a mandatory MacGuffin are all part of the tradition we call film noir. “Guns, dames, and hats” are the order of the day in these brooding period pieces, a bygone era of Hollywood like westerns and musicals. There have been the occasional callbacks with films like L.A. Confidential, Sin City, and even the original Blade Runner repurposing it as a vision of the future — a detail mostly missing from the recent sequel. All of these undertakings require extensive budgets, finding or recreating the trappings and props of the time period, and to develop the visuals required to invoke the all-important atmosphere that defines the film style. Rarely are the words “independent” and “noir” uttered in reference to a feature-length film intended to celebrate and champion a new entry into this staple of the movie industry, but with the right combination of players, passion, and just long enough of a shoestring to fish spare change out of the sewer, can a compelling dark thriller become the end result?

As evidenced by Trouble Is My Business, the answer is a resounding “yes.” Less a passion project than a labor of love, writer-director-actor Thomas Konkle gathered the necessary ingredients and managed to draw forth a film by sheer force of will. With years involved in the writing, planning, independent and personal financing, and using every movie-making trick imaginable, Trouble is to film noir what Once Upon a Time in the West was to the western: the final word. With classic elements, a fresh cast, and painstaking detail, Konkle has created a world both familiar and new. Twists, betrayal, and mystery are finely intertwined with the wit, violence, and eventuality of the genre.

Locations are important to a production like this, but what couldn’t be found and rented had to be created — often digitally. While Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow buckled under the weight of “look what we can do,” Konkle puts his players in the foreground and allowed the story to dictate the effects, not the other way around. With talents like Jordana Capra as matriarch Evelyn Montemar and Vernon Wells as Detective Barry Tate, the production is nearly seemless and perhaps too-real in its detail, from meticulous editing to a sweeping soundtrack. It’s clear what the filmmakers wanted this to become, and the time put into the post production shows what can be done with today’s off-the-shelf filmmaking tools and the ingenuity of modern creators.

Over the last five years, this reviewer has seen several independent productions shaped from concept to completion. From an old-time rocket ship carrying space rangers into the great beyond to a backwoods werewolf reneging on his deal with the devil, there’s no shortage of imagination out there while Hollywood continues to reboot television and movie franchises they never understood to begin with. Trouble sets itself apart in both ambition and execution, and the risk yielded a great reward: a film deserving to be seen and appreciated.""

It perhaps ran a bit long for me, since I am not a hockey fan, but it told the story well overall. I was surprised in one way because back when all of this was going on, it felt to me that the Detroit Red Wings had won the Stanley Cup year in and year out, like the Montreal Canadians used to. Not so much, though they stayed good for a long time. But I was not following the sport closely. I also vaguely remember the accident involving two of the Russian Five, but I never knew it was so preventable and unnecessary. Why was that guy even driving?

_The Delinquent Season_ tells the story of two married couples living in Dublin; Jim (Cillian Murphy) and Danielle (Eva Birthistle), and Chris (Andrew Scott) and Yvonne (Catherine Walker). As the foursome are having dinner one evening, an argument breaks out between Chris and Yvonne, with Chris behaving in a worryingly irrational manner. A few days later, Chris confides in Jim as to why he's been having mood swings of late, swearing Jim to secrecy. Over the next few weeks, as Chris's mood swings become physically aggressive, Yvonne turns to Jim for support, and soon, they are in the midst of an affair. Jim, however, continues to keep Chris's secret.

The film treats well the topic of middle-class malaise and _ennui_, deftly shifting the audience's sympathy multiple times throughout. However, in his feature directorial debut, Mark O'Rowe (best known as the writer of John Crowley's _Intermission_ and Rufus Norris's _Broken_) misses a great opportunity for a really powerful _dénouement_, letting the narrative drag on for 10 minutes or so too long. Still though, it's well acted, and extremely realistic, attaining an almost documentarian objectivity at times. Well worth checking out.,","infidelity,dublin, ireland,marriage,deception,",15,18,"Mark O'Rowe,"

The characters are not relatable to the point of being reprehensible and feel like they lurch their way along like emotional Frankenstein's monsters in difficult or impossible to believe directions with little tangible and no believable character development. The only character that seems to derive any relatability is the teenage niece, Tess, but even she doesn't demonstrate much depth and can be very irritating. Steve Coogan's long-winded speech near the end seems to come out of nowhere with less provocation than he would have clearly had in the past.

Fifteen years of Rooster Teeth. Wow.

Why We’re Here: 15 Years of Rooster Teeth is easily the best of the RT Docs series on so many levels. As someone who's been heavily inspired by Rooster Teeth after being introduced to them in 2015, it was immensely inspiring to actually put a image to what they've talked about on podcasts. From hearing the stories of the early days to opening up about Monty and discussing the future, this is easily the documentary I will show someone when they ask ""What's Rooster Teeth?"",",,23,22,"Mat Hames,"

A Las Vegas bus full of partyers travels though Nevada to the Burning Man Festival when they get stuck in the desert and a diabolical cult attacks. Tara Reid has a small part in the opening act.

“Party Bus to Hell” (2017) has the same basic plot as the even lower-budget “The Craving” (2008), but exchanges the deadly creature for the evil cult, not to mention “The Craving” is serious horror while “Party Bus” is decidedly horror comedy. The desert locations, satanic cultists and goofy-costumes also bring to mind “Race with the Devil” (1975) and “The Road Warrior” (1981) (“Mad Max” is even mentioned in the movie). But it’s by far the least of these with “The Craving” being the best of the lot despite its spare change budget (don’t get me wrong, “The Road Warrior” is definitely worthy and “Race with the Devil” has its points of interest).

The best things about “Party Bus” are the spectacular desert locations, quality soundtrack with some great metal and the amusing, kinetic tone. The inevitable creature looks quite wicked as well. But it’s all diminished by wallowing in a filthy spirit that borders on porn, hampered by sub-par women, except for one or two. Another flaw is the one-dimensional nature of the bulk of the film: A group confined in a bus with ee-vil people attacking outside. It gets dull after a while. The awful “Vampegeddon” (2010) is another micro-budget comparison, but “Party Bus” is significantly better.        

The movie runs 1 hour, 21 minutes and was shot in Nevada.

It is a synthesis of liberated imagination and stringent structure; cross-medial concepts that embellish and enrich our existence, illumination and clarity, order and playfulness. But Bauhaus was never just an artistic experiment. Confronted with the social conditions of that particular time, as well as the experience of WWI, the movement concerned itself with the political and social connotations of design from the very outset.

They aren't even particularly interesting. Finding tangentially connected phrases using arbitrary letter skips that somewhat relate to past events in a massive text isn't particularly groundbreaking. 

Thankfully, the documentary doesn't really focus on apocalyptic Bible codes or even past ones. The narrator mentions it a few times around planned commercial breaks early in the documentary to keep people around, but the most interesting part of the film came near the end. 

The documentary is primarily focused on locating the Ark of the Covenant and the rumored original Torah contained within. This is Tim Smith's, the man who found the codes, goal, as an original copy of the Torah could reveal codes that have been lost to time due to errors from scribes.

While the general theme of the movie, unsurprisingly, is about using the God Code found in the Bible to locate the Ark, other interesting tidbits of information are added as well in regards to the location of Solomon's temple. This information compounds with the code Smith has found regarding the Ark's location.

Of course, the film doesn't offer any opposing information, but overall, it's a fairly interesting History Channel-style documentary, even if the first 30 minutes could be cut out.,","prophecy,bible,biblical code,leningrad codex,",2,1,"Yusup Razykov,"

This is a really interesting documentary about the difficulties of Everest. There are many ways that you can tell an interesting story about the highest point on Earth and this one comes from the perspective of the Sherpa and their quest to de-trash the mountain.

It's very matter-of-fact with most of the camera work on the ascent being shot on GoPro's worn by the Sherpa themselves. It totally works and Patrick Stewart's narration does a good job filling in any gaps. The Sherpa themselves are interesting and give us a great perspective on their experience.

It's a great watch for people who appreciate the environment and are interested in being a good steward.
