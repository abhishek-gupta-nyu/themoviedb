I did indeed have some enjoyment watching this movie. However, it could have been a lot better.

For starters, what is the point of making a movie about a bloody “dinosaur shark” and aim for a PG-13 rating? Whoever made that incredibly stupid decision obviously missed the mark big time. I think this was the biggest fault with the movie. There were so many missed opportunities. The entire scene at the beach at the end of the movie was just wasted for example.

The script was of course somewhat illogical with holes in it large enough to drive a, well, a Megalodon through them. This however was something that I more or less expected given the kind of movie. First of all it is science fiction and fantasy after all and second, it appears that these kind of movies never seem to get anything better than mediocre script writers…at best.

There were some good things though. I have read the book and I didn’t really like it. In my review I gave it 2 out 5 five stars. The main reason for this was that the book was more of a bad soap opera than a horror/thriller. It was so filled with unlikable, scheming and backstabbing assholes that it was really not enjoyable. Jason’s ex wife was such a despicable bitch that she alone ruined the book for example.

Luckily the movie had toned down that aspect of the book quite a lot. Actually, in the end, there was really only one truly despicable asshole in the movie and he met with the fate that he deserved thanks to his own stupidity.

So, I did enjoy the movie and, as a science fiction and fantasy fan, I am glad to have watched it. I mean, a giant pre-historic shark on the big screen does have a certain cool-factor after all. It was somewhat saved by Jason Statham being in it though and it could have been a lot better.,Child friendly horror...

You have to take in to context the post release statements by director Jon Turteltaub and lead actor Jason Statham. The Meg is not the film they either read on the page or filmed as a course of grisly schlock entertainment. This was meant to be a proper schlocker, a bloodletting monster of the deep on the loose picture, sadly the suits at the helm didn't see that as a viable money making exercise and had this cut to be a ""12"" friendly bums on theatre seats cash grabber. Shame on them.

What we get is a run of the mill creature feature that although once viewed does not leave a lasting impression (was anyone really hoping for that anyway?), but is kind of fun in that time filling sort of way. It runs through the modern day creature feature playbook 101. So off we go with the hero having a troubled backstory, a money made funder out of his depth, ladies with life quandaries, a man who can't swim working in the middle of the ocean! and on we go. Throw in some quite awfully scripted dialogue and it's cheese sarnie time.

Statham is nearly always a good watch - in the muscle bound action hero kind of way - though you see the cracks between what the film was meant to be and what it ended up as. For you see that The Stath comes off as taking it all too seriously, which in this released cut is ridiculous. He's surrounded by no mark actors, though no short supply of beauty (Bingbing Li socko gorgeous/Ruby Rose hard sexy) and the narrative feeds us all the pointers of exactly where this will end up. There's a couple of nifty fun homages to Jaws, some decent suspense scenes, and the cinematography (Tom Stern) is pin sharp and pleasurable.

Best bet to enjoy this is to know it's a ""12"" rated friendly piece, to understand it has ultimately ended up as a same old same old monster movie. It's a million miles away from the class of Jaws, and lacks the tongue in cheek knowing of Deep Blue Sea, but it fills a gap in that undemanding time wasting way. 5/10,It's nice to see a Shark-led Creature Feature that's actually got some money behind it, but _The Meg_ is still really nothing special.

- ""122 Amazing Social Media Statistics and Facts"" (Kit Smith); _BrandWatch_ (January 2, 2019)

_Searching_ is a film with two main organisational principles; there's the thriller plot, which ostensibly keeps everything moving, and to which everything else should, in theory, be in service. Then there's the aesthetic design, with the entire film taking place online, the images presented taking the form of what is seen on computer screens, iPhones, security cameras etc. One of these principles is exceptionally well handled, the other isn't, and it shouldn't take a genius to guess which is which. If we're being really honest, in fact, the plot becomes more and more incidental as the narrative progresses and ever more ludicrous flights of fancy are introduced, transposing the story from a search for a missing girl into a litany of clichés and melodrama. On the other hand, the main reason, indeed probably the only reason any of us saw the film at all is because of its unique visual schema, and thankfully, this aspect is realised with an impressive degree of craft. You know you're in reasonably secure territory when the filmmakers are self-aware enough to begin an online film depicting the latest in consumer technology with the sound of an old dial-up connection.

Written by Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian, and directed by Chaganty, the film begins with a montage of video clips depicting various events in the recent lives of David Kim (John Cho), his wife Pamela (Sara Sohn), and their daughter Margot (Michelle La). The montage covers several years, taking in Margot's childhood, Pamela's diagnosis with cancer, the disease going into remission, her relapse, and, finally, her deterioration and eventual death. This brings us up to roughly the present day, with Margot now a teenager who has drifted apart from her father, although David himself doesn't seem to have noticed. In the early hours of the morning on a night when Margot left the house to attend a study group, she calls David three times, but he is asleep and doesn't hear the phone. Seeing the missed calls the next morning, and realising Margot isn't in the house, he tries to call her back, but her phone is turned off. Assuming she left early to attend a piano lesson, he calls the teacher, but she tells him Margot cancelled the lessons six months prior. Thereafter, he discovers that the money he had been giving her for her lessons was instead being deposited into her bank account, and, several weeks ago, the entirety was transferred to a now deactivated Venmo account. Frantic, David reports her missing, with the case assigned to Det. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing). However, as David and Vick begin to delve deeper into Margot's life, David is shocked to learn she has no friends at school, and has instead an online existence of which he knew nothing. Meanwhile, every investigative avenue seems to throw up another mystery, and as time passes, it begins to look more and more as if Margot has simply run away. David, however, refuses to believe this, with his wildly vacillating suspicions regarding who may have been behind her disappearance ranging from a friendly YouCast (video blogging site) user, a disrespectful pot-smoking Facebook user, his own brother Peter (Joseph Lee), and everyone in between.

Although the plot has a reasonably strong forward momentum, with a well-judged pace, it comes across as initially insipid, and ultimately rather ridiculous. If this was a standardly shot film, without the unique visual design, no one would be giving it a second glance – the thriller plot is clichéd, derivative, and trite, and despite the foolishness into which it descends, it's also fairly predictable (I guessed who the villain was, although not why they were so villainous). In this sense, the film reminds me of something like Robert Montgomery's _Lady in the Lake_ (1946) or Sebastian Schipper's _Victoria_ (2015). Both feature dull and hackneyed plots that serve only as something onto which to hang the structure, rather than the other way around; _Lady in the Lake_ is shot entirely in the first-person, whilst _Victoria_ is shot in a single continuous take, and neither is worth looking at for their plot, characters, or dialogue.

With this in mind, the aesthetic aspect of _Searching_ is much more successful, with almost the entire film taking place on a computer screen, with Facetime conversations, iPhone messages, security camera footage, and TV material rounding out the design. It's a fascinating hook, and thankfully, it does more than simply exist to carry a poorly written plot – the filmmakers actually have something to say, albeit nothing too revolutionary.

The first thing to know is that the aesthetic is extremely well crafted; from Chaganty's direction to Juan Sebastian Baron's cinematography, to, especially, Nicholas D. Johnson and Will Merrick's editing; logistically, this can't have been an easy film to plan or shoot, and the fact that the various components that go into making up the final image all work so well together suggests a great degree of care. In tandem with this, whilst the overarching plot is poor, Chaganty and Ohanian's writing is excellent in terms of how it continually finds natural ways to confine the action to a screen – whether it's David looking into Margot's finances, Vick watching FaceTime conversations, TV news showing security footage – never once did it feel like a gimmick, like it was being forced to stay within the computer screen simply to satisfy an abstract aesthetic rubric. It all worked reasonably organically, and after a few minutes of acclimating yourself, you barely even register it anymore.

Within this, the filmmakers are even able to throw up a few surprises. For example, the structure grants us more access to David's interiority than would be possible in a regular film. How so? Simple – by employing something we've all done, many times. On several occasions, David is shown typing something during a conversation, only to delete it, and send something completely different, whether because the first message was angry, or emotionally revealing, or accusatory etc. Anyone who has spent any amount of time talking online or via text will be familiar with this, and the use of it in the film allows us a glance into his psyche, showing us where his mind is in an unfiltered sense, before self-censorship kicks in. It only happens a few times (if it happened too much, it would become meaningless), but it really does impart a degree of psychological verisimilitude that I wasn't expecting.

Additionally, as mentioned earlier, the film actually uses the visual design to offer some social commentary, which is, again, something I wasn't expecting. Chaganty himself is a former Google Creative Lab employee, so he would know a thing or two about issues such as the uses and over-uses of technology, the unpleasant side of online culture, and the notion of digital footprints, and it is these areas where most of the film's more salient points are concentrated. For example, the addiction to technology and social media so prevalent in today's culture is right there in the set-up – the entire Kim family are obsessed with speaking to one another via phones and computers, and recording pretty much everything, often at the expense of having more natural face-to-face conversations. Another subject is the toxicity of the internet, the prevalence of online troll culture, and the tendency for people to say things online that they never would in person, believing that the anonymity afforded by the internet gives them the right to be unpleasant. This is communicated primarily through one scene – after watching a news report about Margot on YouTube, David begins reading the comments, which almost immediately start making jokes about him having killed her, and being ""father of the year"" (presented as a meme, obviously, because typing is such a drag).

A very pertinent topic in the wake of Trump's election is the dissemination of fake news, and this is conveyed through a half-funny, half-unpleasant scene – shortly after realising Margot is missing, David speaks to Abigail (Briana McLean), at whose house the study group had taken place, who confesses that she barely knew Margot. Later on, however, when the media is swarming all over the case, she is seen on the news, tearfully lamenting how much she misses her ""best friend."" The impossibility of ever being invisible online is another topic. Yes, the film is about a person who had an entire online existence that no one knew about, but that was only because no one had looked. Once someone did, and once a few threads were pulled, everything is exposed, as the impossibility of erasing ones digital footprint becomes manifest in the story. Anyone who has spent any amount of time online will be familiar with many of these issues, and the fact that they all ring so true, without the film becoming preachy, is a testament to the quality of the filmmaking.

Finally, and this cannot be overemphasised, the film includes a pitch-perfect, perfectly timed, perfectly delivered Justin Bieber joke that is absolutely hilarious, and has to be seen to be appreciated.,","california,stalker,thriller,disappearance,internet,police detective,missing person,missing child,computer screen,social media,missing daughter,facebook,live stream,father daughter relationship,search and rescue,",46,28,"Aneesh Chaganty,"

Christopher Robin (Ewan McGregor) is in his 40s, married with a daughter, and working the joyless grind in London when his pal Winnie-the-Pooh unexpectedly shows up. He takes the stuffed animal back to his childhood haunts in Hundred Acre Wood to find Pooh’s other stuffed animal friends. Hayley Atwell and Bronte Carmichael play Christopher’s wife and daughter.

Released in 2018, ""Christopher Robin"" is a decent live-action rendering of A.A. Milne’s popular characters with the twist that Christopher is an adult rediscovering his childhood friends and the simple joys thereof. The theme of escaping the work grind and getting your inspiration back recalls “Joe Versus the Volcano” (1990), “City Slickers” (1991) and probably a gazillion other flicks. The stuffed animal critters are ultra-cute, the story is simple and the English cinematography is exquisite. I would’ve preferred a more gripping story, but I think the creators kept it simple on purpose.

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot entirely in England (London, Berkshire, Kent & East Sussex).

But I can appreciate that it's very well made, culturally very important, and even kind of endearing.

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._,Crazy Rich Asians expends its expensive mahjong skills to produce a hilarious heartfelt insight into a familial cultural clash. Romantic comedies. The amalgamation of two genres that exercise the very worst tendencies of Hollywood’s mechanical repetitions. Modern romcoms follow the same formulaic narrative structure and embed the same interpretive clichés. Y’know what I’m talking about. Boy and girl fall desperately in love, something/someone comes between them, they fight, break-up and embrace each other again, to the accompaniment of Coldplay or Ed Sheeran, when they realise that “they are the one”. All the same mundane clichés that fail to exert the writing capacity to take those mechanisms and overload them with ferocious energy.

Well, Chu’s adaptation of the eponymous best-selling novel battles that. He consumes the cliché-ridden narrative structure of a romcom and transforms it into a cultural depiction of Asian traditions, juxtaposing the values of American immigrants, whilst still bashing the familiar beats of “boy meets girl”. And let me tell you now, this is without a doubt, the best romcom since ‘Bridesmaids’. I loved it! Rachel is invited by her new boyfriend Nick to Singapore to meet his family who are attending a wedding, but without realising Nick’s family is one of the wealthiest, infamous and superficial in the country.

Chu tackles several poignant themes and morals within this two hour romantic comedy, whilst retaining a sufficient amount of investable character development and hilarity. Yes, the underlying story between Rachel and Nick is a predictable ordeal, but much like any film within the genre, acts as the backbone for the additional qualities. One of them being the exploration into Asian culture, particularly the continent’s cuisine, highlighting the traditions that contrast with the typical audience member. I cautiously read somewhere, that Crazy Rich Asians was the “whitest romcom featuring a non-white cast”, which is an absolute barbaric statement to form. The predominant cast and crew were all of Asian descent. Just because the film was confounded within the Hollywood system, does not discredit the contents of its insight. Overtly politically correct viewers bumbling about a non-issue. I’m sure ‘Black Panther’ didn’t receive the same criticism from them. Anyway! I digress.

The point is, Chu allows the illustration of traditions and values to be accessible for everyone. However it’s not just a cultural clash. Wealth and public image are two contributing factors to the spiky relationship between Rachel and and Nick’s family. Yet neither one of them are viewed as the antagonistic force of the plot. Every character is treated as a delicate human, with sufficient back story and development, to warrant their choices and actions. A sub-plot involving an affair could’ve been a “how dare you!? We’re over!” situation, but Chu manages to present the reasoning of the immoral act and add that subtle layer of empathy. You understand. You feel. You reflect. And there are several poignant moments throughout, like this, that elevate the contextual values that are insightfully divulged.

Of course though, Awkwafina provides the majority of laughs, demonstrating the creative humour of writers Chiarelli and Lim whilst showcasing her own excellent comedic timing. Conversely, Wu and Yeoh focus on levelling the comedy with romance and drama respectively. They do so with blinding results. Expressing a variety of emotions, participating in tantalising chemistry and bringing their A-game (their...acting game...).

The lavish ‘Great Gatsby’ parties and genuinely beautiful weddings, that performed a rendition of my all-time favourite romantic song “Can’t Help Falling In Love With You” by Elvis “Hound Dog” Presley, nearly brought a tear to my eye with the astounding production design. Minor nuances such as the pop soundtrack, including Coldplay, sung in Mandarin, dumplings being everything and my eternal yearning for marriage, rounded off the rough edges of Crazy Rich Asians smoothly.

It is absolutely refreshing to see a high-ticketed American produced romcom have an entirely Asian cast and crew, granting several new opportunities for those involved. It is absurdly reassuring to witness a cliché-ridden and formulaic narrative of the genre be fully exploited in a wonderfully entertaining story that harnesses every angle available. Yet most importantly, it’s a colossal piece of entertainment that can legitimately be enjoyed by everyone. Crazy fun, rich in characters and quintessentially Asian.

In other words, it's a silly mystery movie with crazy, zany twists and turns.

Some of those twists and turns were easy enough to see coming, but some of them were straight out of left field. In addition to the entertaining twists, the film does a decent job of not taking itself seriously. The humor in the movie is peppered in during great moments. Some of it is cheesy, but if you're going to this film for a deep, thought-provoking film, don't.

The characters themselves are all extremely exaggerated. Lively's Emily is over-the-top sophisticated, crass, and private to the point where she won't allow pictures or even paintings of her face. Kendrick's Stephanie is bubbly, eager, awkward, and overly friendly. The rest of the cast fills in the needs around them, and while the cast is filled with one-note characters, they fulfill the needs well. Golding's Sean was my least favorite, but mainly because he doesn't have a defined archetype in a film filled with single-aspect characters.

The biggest issue with the film is the plot itself. Emily contradicts herself with the motive for her faking her own death. She tells Sean that she did it for him and for Nicky. Then she says she did it for her. On top of it all, she doesn't appear to have a plan to get the insurance money after it comes through. The film could have easily alleviated all of these issues with a quick scene or a line about fake passports for Emily and Nicky.

All in all, A Simple Favor is a fun romp filled with crazy twists and turns, humor, and great acting. Don't think too much about the film itself, and just go have some fun. It's definitely worth a getaway matinee.,I **really** don't know what vibe _A Simple Favor_ was going for, but I know I kinda liked it.

- Darcey Bell; _A Simple Favour_ (2017)

Examining the rotten core beneath the surface urbanity of suburbia is something that has attracted filmmakers as diverse as Alfred Hitchcock (_Shadow of a Doubt_), David Lynch (_Blue Velvet_ and _Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me_), Joe Dante (_The 'Burbs)_, Gus Van Sant (_To Die For_), and Frank Oz (_The Stepford Wives_). More recently, novels such as Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel, _Gone Girl_ (and David Fincher's 2014 filmic adaptation), have expanded and popularised the suburban noir genre; the very genre that _A Simple Favour_'s satirical excesses primarily target. A comedic look at the lives of two young mothers in an affluent American suburb, coupled with a mystery plot, the film has an undeniable identity crisis due to its genre mash-up characteristics (it's a comic/satirical suburban noir murder mystery thriller). Although director Paul Feig proves adept at handling the parodic side of things, in the latter stages, he seems to be trying to ensure the film can exist (relatively) un-ironically within the very genre it's attempting to lampoon. And he doesn't particularly succeed. Despite this schizophrenic quality, however, the interplay between the two leads, the heavy stylisation, the playfully self-aware nature of the aesthetic, and the success of the burlesque elements all serve to make the film undeniably entertaining.

Adapted by Jessica Sharzer from Darcey Bell's 2017 novel, _A Simple Favour_ tells the story of Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), a widowed single-mum who runs a life hacks vlog with minimal viewership. Overzealous in her desire to be liked, to the point where she's deeply unlikable, Stephanie is the kind of person who signs up for every volunteer project at her son's school, and then feigns surprise when she's told she can only work on one at a time. Enter Emily Nelson (Blake Lively), a public relations executive for a major fashion label. When Miles (Joshua Satine) and Nicky (Ian Ho), Stephanie and Emily's sons, respectively, ask for a playdate, Emily is initially unenthusiastic. However, she acquiesces, and she and Stephanie are soon bonding over increasingly strong martinis and girl chats, with Stephanie in awe of Emily, who seems to have it all; a good-looking novelist/lecturer husband, Sean (Henry Golding), a gorgeous house, a successful career, a great kid, and an acerbic attitude that Stephanie would kill for. However, all is not as perfect as it first seems; there are not insignificant financial problems; when Stephanie takes a photograph of Emily, Emily reacts angrily, demanding Stephanie delete it; although she and Sean have a great physical relationship, there isn't much else there, with Emily frustrated that his only successful novel was published over ten years ago. Several weeks later, with Emily held up at work, she asks Stephanie to pick up Nicky, and she'll collect him later. Except she doesn't collect him. As a few days go by, and no one seems to know where Emily is, Stephanie and Sean report her missing. However, unsatisfied with the direction the investigation is taking, Stephanie is soon amateur sleuthing her way across the country in an effort to track down her friend.

Obviously taking inspiration from suburban-based ""mommy murder mysteries"" such as _Gone Girl_ and Paula Hawkins's 2012 _The Girl on the Train_, as well as films such as Stanley Donen's _Charade_ (1963), _A Simple Favour_ is at its best when working as a parody/satire of such narratives, its own source material included. From what little I know of the book, it seems as if everything is played straight, with little discernible sense of sarcasm, even as the plot twists become ever more ludicrous. With this in mind, it makes sense that the filmmakers have elected to adapt such un-ironically thrashy material in a more self-reflexive manner, as this facilitates the gentle (and often not so gentle) ribbing of the genre, exposing some of its more ill-conceived and unrealistic tropes to ridicule. For example, the three main characters are all standard generic templates to the point of cliché; the _ingénue_ who feels honour-bound to do everything she can to find the truth, no matter the cost, ultimately learning as much about herself as anything else; the sardonic, caustic, and utterly shady plot catalyst, who always seems to have an ace up her sleeve and always seems to know more than anyone else; and, the brilliant but frustrated spouse who may, or may not, be in on the crime at the narrative's centre. However, their archetypal characteristics are dialled up to such a degree (Stephanie is the definition of innocence, Emily is the type of person that simply doesn't exist in the real world, Sean is impossibly attractive, funny, intelligent, and kind), that they can't help but seem caricatures. Similarly, everything is presented in such a nonchalant and laid back manner that the twists, which in a more self-serious film would occupy centre stage, are often rendered absurd. However, and this is the key point, _A Simple Favour_ is very much in on the joke. Most of the time.

Opening with a late 1960s Europop-influenced Saul Bass-esque title sequence complete with sliding split-screens and pastel colours, scored to Jean Paul Keller's 1967 ""Ca s'est arrange"", the film signals its playful tone right from the off. This emphasis on stylisation is perhaps seen most clearly upon Emily's introduction. As Stephanie, Miles, and Nicky shelter from the rain, Emily emerges from a car in slow motion, with the camera starting on her feet before slowly moving up to her head as she raises an umbrella. Cutting to a mid-shot, she then begins to walk across the carpark (still in slow motion), as a broken umbrella blows past her, replacing the tumbleweed of a classic western shootout. Apart from being a memorable introduction to the character, the visual design of the scene is predicated on cine-literacy, showing that the filmmakers are more than aware of standard genre tropes, and, more importantly, how to employ them for comedic effect.

Indeed, the entire film revels in its own intertextual awareness, with later references to such defining noir texts as George Cukor's _Gaslight_ (1944), Alfred Hitchcock's _Spellbound_ (1945), and Henri-Georges Clouzet's _Les diaboliques_ (1955). Another element of this awareness is the use of a fractured narrative structure, so beloved of classic noir mysteries. Large portions of the film feature narration within narration (and oftentimes narration within narration within narration), as well as making use of another classic noir staple; the unreliable narrator. The film gets significant mileage out of scenes where the aural narration doesn't even come close to matching the visuals; i.e., the narrator is lying, and both the narratee and the audience are aware of such. An especially funny example of this is when Stephanie tells Emily about kissing her step-brother after their father's funeral, and Emily immediately knows she is lying that she only kissed him (leading to her new nickname for Stephanie, ""_brotherfucker_""). Whilst the narrator (Stephanie) flat-out denies she slept with him, the audience sees them having sex, confirming the narratee's (Emily) suspicions. This technique is used several times in the film, and it's an extremely well-handled narrative device.

The film's main target for satire, however, is not really a specific genre (suburban noir) or even the tropes that define that genre – it's the _milieu_ that enables the existence of that genre in the first place. Together, Stephanie, Emily, and Sean represent everything that's rotten with the sterilised, emotionally deadening middle-class suburban sphere in which they're (seemingly) trapped. However, the film doesn't condemn them for being horrible people, rather it exults in their awfulness, deftly directing, redirecting, and misdirecting the audience's sympathies, to the point where it becomes difficult to say who is screwing over whom. Every time the film seems to settle on who the villains are, it does something to disrupt the audience's perceptions, and oftentimes, so as to achieve maximum satirical impact, precisely when the character we are now being asked to empathise with is up to something somewhat less than moral. This is the very essence of black comedy – the film presents a hideous world populated by hideous people who do hideous things to one another, but it does so in such a cheerful and uplifting manner that you simply can't help but laugh at the shenanigans.

In relation to this, the film works especially well when jauntily charting the friendship between Stephanie and Emily, two women who have no businesses co-existing. I don't particularly understand Anna Kendrick's popularity. Although she seems perfectly amiable in real-life, she plays the exact same character in every film, and that character is Anna Kendrick. However, it works here because, a) it's the perfect foil to the ""screw-you"" persona of Emily, and b) Kendrick and Lively have such effortless chemistry (it's one of those films that, as you watch, you know they had a blast making). The two women are just so fundamentally different that it wouldn't take much to make their early scenes together work, but everything is in place to amplify the comedy – the lively script, the great acting, the unintrusive direction, the brightly-lit and garish interiors, the clashing wardrobes. Lively plays Emily as a mischievous, experienced charmer, the kind of person who acts like they know your secrets ten seconds after meeting you, whilst Kendrick's Stephanie is all self-deprecating intellectualism, trailed-off sentences, and statements phrased like questions. Frankly, I could have watched two hours of just the two of them trading good-natured barbs, pushing each other's buttons, and swapping sex stories.

If there was one element of the film that didn't work, however, it was the mystery plot. Yes, I get that it's all a satire of the multi-twist-for-twist's-sake suburban murder mystery, with the preposterousness of such plots played for maximum farcicality. However, the satirical underpinning doesn't change the fact that the entire mystery at the film's centre is insipid, uninteresting, and predictable, whilst Feig seems patently unable to bridge the tone of the frothier comic moments and the darker ones which become increasingly prevalent towards the end. Granted, the film is not a spoof, à la something like Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker's _Airplane!_ (1980), so we can't expect absurdist humour throughout, but nevertheless, rather than choosing to employ a relatively even tone, Feig seems to have made the decision to mix scenes of outright comedy with predominantly serious scenes devoid of laughter. And it doesn't work. For example, the film features a scene in which someone who has just been ploughed by a car and is trying to crawl away is nonchalantly told if they don't stop, they're going to hurt their knees. That's pretty dark, but it's also pretty funny. However, it comes only a short while after a scene in which a drug-addict is held under the water and drowned. Not a huge amount to laugh at there. If scenes of this nature are supposed to be satiric, and hence feed into the film's engagement with the suburban noir, I couldn't see any evidence of it, and as a result, the tonal disparity becomes very jarring towards the end.

For all that, however, I found _A Simple Favour_ enjoyable. The purely-satirical early scenes earn enough goodwill so that the less successful more plot-heavy later scenes don't completely tear the whole thing down. The film as a whole shines a not unwelcome light on the increasingly self-important suburban noir, and for the most part, the parody is very well-judged. When the comedy is forced to retreat in the service of more serious material, the tonal balance is definitely knocked off, as the film comes dangerously close to valorising that which it has set out to mock. Despite this, however, _A Simple Favour_ remains entertaining. Distractingly attractive people wear ridiculously stylish clothes in a stylised cine-literate parody – it won't change your life, but it's a very rewarding couple of hours.,","based on novel or book,secret,small town,widow,female friendship,life insurance,best friend,missing person,vlogger,",54,106,"Paul Feig,"

Read the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2019/3/16/destination-wedding.html,Good watch, could watch again, but can't honestly recommend.

This is a very odd movie.  It is literally Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder playing awful people (allegedly ""the worst"", as claimed by family).  Like, they're so ""bad"" that they openly talk around and away biological survival instincts.

I think if you like ""Clerks"" (or Kevin Smith movies), then you might actually like this.  It's definitely dialogue heavy with some interesting conversation.

The weird twist is that this is clearly intended as a romantic (non-) comedy, so there is a difficultly level in making these 2 particular characters interested in each other, let alone acting on it that I think both the writing and actors manage wonderfully.

I personally struggled with it, because if I sat on a plane with Winona Ryder acting like she does in this movie, I still would have been into her.  I'm honestly not sure if its because I think they actually make good points (which worries me about me) or I just find her that attractive.

There is a neat sociological perspective here, but it is almost all character interaction, between 2 characters, so I would completely understand if there is limited interest for this one.,","california,pessimism,cynic,",8,26,"Victor Levin,"

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._,Decent watch at best, probably won't watch again, and can't really recommend.

I'm a big fan of Joey King, but she wasn't really in a positive to save the movie.

The production value is obviously there, the effects are even good, and there are several intense moments that should set the atmosphere, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.

The writing has to be to blame.  It's 4-5 shallow, empty characters with just enough flavor to tell them apart, and I just can't care about them.

The movie focuses on the subtly of it all, the growing madness that Slender Man instills in his victims without properly building the tension or showing the characters slowly losing it, which would have given good actors the ability to save it.  Instead they use a lot of ""it happened offscreen"" or sudden cuts to show a lose of time, and we get a character suddenly looking confused instead of taking the audience on a journey with the character.

Maybe it's not the writing, and maybe the editor just didn't know what they were doing?  ""What are all these long dramatic series in here?  This is so boring!  *cut* Eh, they'll get the point.""

With all the options out there, I just don't think this is worth your time.  I could tell you to just watch the 3rd act, and you'd probably get as much out of this movie as you're going to get from the beginning.,","small town,massachusetts,forest,supernatural,urban legend,fear,slender man,",16,23,"Sylvain White,"

While the musical part of the musical is fun and well performed, I didn't realize I was going to watch a musical unless (basically) seconds before I clicked play.  I was wondering why Disney rebooted this title, but it's clear that this is it's own thing that happens to share the title because it's under the same company.

The ""magical"" hourglass, though an awkward prop, is a much better magic medium than a ""cookie"", and ""The Hunt"" is a good enough of an idea that they could have made a entire movie based on that, without anything else and it has potential to be a best seller.  I also liked that they developed a lot of the supporting actors and antagonist in this version.

However sometimes they do that because the main characters are weak and they need to compensate.  Part of it the way they're written, and it's not like these are bad actors, but they're low level actors that probably were selected based on contracts and musical experience, and I'll be honest: I didn't care for most of the acting in this.

1/3 of the way through and so far it's rather annoying. Ridiculous dialog, unrealistic feel and cliche stuff that copies recent successful shows/movies. I'll finish it later but I'm not expecting much. OK...finished it! It actually ends up better than it started. I think it could have been vastly improved with a few changes. It tries too hard in places and a few of the characters were unrealistic or maybe the acting was just bad. The dad was acted poorly and the neighbor girl was too old and unbelievable. She seemed like some 25-year-old Playboy Bunny crushing on the nerdy kid she used to babysit. There is no universe in the multiverse where this would happen. All that said, the conclusion was pretty good and obviously opens it up for a sequel at some point.  I really thought the it was setting up for a giant twist where the guy who you thought was the killer was innocent and the real killer was the hot neighbor girl. That would have explained her unhealthy obsession with the boy next door. 6/10.,","camera,friendship,paperboy,cop,murder,basement,suburbia,serial killer,teenage crush,teenager,walkie talkie,group of friends,news report,1980s,retro horror,",20,29,"Yoann-Karl Whissell,"

- Sarah Waters; _The Little Stranger_ (2009)

I remember when I first saw Paul Thomas Anderson's _Inherent Vice_ (which I loved) in 2014, a colleague of mine (who hated it) was unable to grasp why I had enjoyed it so much. I tried to explain that if he had read Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel, he'd have appreciated the film a lot more, to which he posited, ""_one shouldn't have to read the book in order to appreciate the film._"" I think I mumbled something about him being a philistine, and may have thrown some rocks at him at that point. So imagine my chagrin when I watched the decidedly underwhelming _The Little Stranger_, a huge box office bomb ($417,000 gross in its opening weekend in the US), and easily the weakest film in director Lenny Abrahamson's thus far impressive _oeuvre_. You see, I really disliked it, but the few people I know who have read Sarah Waters's 2009 novel (which I have not), have universally loved it, telling me I would have liked it a lot more if I was familiar with the source material. To them, I can say only this – ""_one shouldn't have to read the book in order to appreciate the film._"" It seems my colleague was right after all. I hate that.

The film is set in Warwickshire, a West Midlands county in England, in 1948, where Dr. Faraday (Domhnall Gleeson) is a country physician whose life is going nowhere fast. Born into humble beginnings, ever since he was a child, he has wanted to be a member of the gentry. In 1919, he attended a fête at the opulent Hundreds Hall estate, owned by the aristocratic Ayers family, where his mother worked as a maid, and ever since he has been quietly obsessed with the house. However, by 1948, Hundreds has lost its lustre, is in a state of disrepair, and is now home to only four people – Angela Ayers (Charlotte Rampling), matriarch of the Ayers dynasty, and who never recovered from the death of her eight-year-old daughter, Susan, many years previously; Caroline (Ruth Wilson), her daughter; Roderick (Will Poulter), Angela's son, a badly-burned former RAF pilot suffering from PTSD; and Betty (Liv Hill), the maid. When Betty takes ill, Faraday is summoned, almost immediately learning that the family is in a dire state, with Angela unable to balance their diminished financial situation with the social responsibility of maintaining the estate. Betty also intimates to Faraday that ""something"" is not right in the house. Offering to treat Roderick's painful burns, Faraday soon ingratiates himself into the family, and becomes a semi-permanent presence in Hundreds. However, that's when things start to go wrong; a child is mauled by a previously passive dog, a mysterious fire guts the library, and noises can be heard throughout the house. As Caroline determines to leave, Faraday attempts to convince everyone there is nothing supernatural happening. Nevertheless, Angela is certain the spirit of Susan is with them; Caroline believes it all has something to do with Roderick's deep unhappiness; Roderick asserts it is something that wants to drive him mad and deprive him of his birthright; and Betty believes it is the malevolent spirit of a former domestic servant. Meanwhile, Faraday and Caroline become romantically involved.

As mentioned above, I haven't read the novel, so most of the proceeding comments are in relation to the film only. Aspiring to blend elements of ""big house""-based mystery narratives such as Charlotte Brönte's _Jane Eyre_ (1847), Charles Dickens's _Great Expectations_ (1861), and Daphne du Maurier's _Rebecca_ (1938), with more gothic-infused ghost stories such as Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" (1839), Henry James's _The Turn of the Screw_ (1898), and Shirley Jackson's _The Haunting of Hill House_ (1959), _The Little Stranger_ is not especially interested in the supernatural aspects of the story _per se_. In this sense, Abrahamson and screenwriter Lucinda Coxon have, to a certain extent, created an anti-ghost story which eschews virtually every trope of the genre. More a chamber drama than anything else, the film has been done absolutely no favours whatsoever by its trailer, which emphasises the haunted house elements and encroaching psychological dread (the fact that the film was pushed back from intended release dates several times suggest the studio themselves didn't know quite what they had on their hands). Indeed, to even mention the supernatural elements at all is essentially to give away the last 20 minutes of the film, as this is where 90% of them are contained.

Waters herself has stated she does not consider the novel a ghost story. Instead, she was primarily interested in the rise of socialism in England, the landslide Labour victory in the 1945 general election, and how the now fading nobility was dealing with the decline in their power, influence, and financial opulence;

> _I didn't set out to write a haunted house novel. I wanted to write about what happened to class in that post-war setting. It was a time of turmoil in exciting ways. Working class people had come out of the war with higher expectations. They had voted in the Labour government. They wanted change. So it was a culture in a state of change. But obviously, for some people, it was a change for the worse._

With this in mind, the main theme of the film is Faraday's attempts to ingratiate himself with the Ayers family, to transform himself into a fully-fledged blue blood, even when doing so goes against his medical training; his commitment to his own upward mobility is far stronger than his commitment to the Hippocratic Oath. He is immediately dismissive of the possibility of any supernatural agency in the house, and, far more morally repugnant, he does everything he can to convince those who believe the house is haunted that they are losing their minds, that the stress of what has happened to the family has pushed them to the point of a nervous breakdown. He's also something of a passive-aggressive misogynist, telling Caroline, ""_you have it your way – for now_"", and ""_Darling, you're confused_"". For all intents and purposes, Faraday is the villain of the piece, which is, in and of itself, an interesting spin on a well-trodden narrative path.

However, for me, virtually nothing about the film worked. Yes, it has been horribly advertised, and yes, it is more interested in playing with our notions of what a ghost story can be, subverting and outright rebelling against the tropes of the genre. I understand what Abrahamson was trying to do (after all, my all-time favourite horror movie, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999) is all about psychologically disturbing the audience, with not a jump scare in sight), however, so too does _The Little Stranger_ shun the standard alternative to jump scares – creeping existential dread – and as a result, it remains all very subtle, and all very, very boring – the non-supernatural parts of the story give us nothing we haven't seen before, and the supernatural parts simply fall flat (the ""twist"" at the end is also incredibly predictable).

One of the main issues for me is Faraday's emotional detachment. I get that he's the ostensible villain, so we're not meant to empathise with him, and, as an unreliable narrator, his very role is to objectively undermine the subjective realism of the piece, and disrupt the smooth path of the narrative transmission (the same role performed by the Second Mrs. de Winter in _Rebecca_). However, Gleeson/Faraday practically sleepwalks his way through the entire film, getting excited or upset about (almost) nothing; on a stroll through the estate with Caroline, she apologises for dragging him out into the cold, and he replies, ""_Not at all. I'm enjoying myself very much_"", in the most dead-tone unenthusiastic voice you could possibly imagine, sounding more like he is having his testicles sandpapered (this part also elicited the film's only laugh at the screening I attended). So I know detachment is precisely the point, but, firstly, we've seen Gleeson play this exact same character before – all brittle, buttoned-down intellectualism – and secondly, he comes across as more robotic than detached, and after twenty minutes, I was thoroughly bored of him, and just stopped caring. Indeed, all of the characters are somewhat buttoned down, but Rampling, Wilson, and Poulter all give more nuanced performances than Gleeson.

Partly because of this, and partly because of Coxon's repetitive script, the film is just insanely and unrelentingly dull. Now, I don't mind films in which nothing dramatic happens (Chloé Zhao's _The Rider_ (2017), which barely has a plot, is one of my films of the year), but in _The Little Stranger_ nothing whatsoever happens at all, dramatic or otherwise. By way of comparison, check out Oz Perkin's _I Am the Pretty Thing that Lives in the House_ (2016), a similarly themed film which shuns jump scares but whose encroaching sense of dread creates a potently eldritch tone, something sorely lacking in _The Little Stranger_. Instead, the script just goes round and round, through the motions; ""_this house is haunted_"" – ""_no, you're just tired_"" – ""_you're probably right_"" – ""_I am, have a lie down_"" – ""_okay. Wait, this house is haunted_"" – ""_no, you're just tired_"", etc.; wash, rinse, repeat. The pacing is absolutely torturous, and I certainly envy anyone who was able to get more out of the narrative than the opportunity to take a nap.

One thing I will praise unreservedly is the sound design. Foregrounded multiple times, this aspect of the film often becomes more important than the visuals. For example, sound edits often bridge picture edits in both directions (L Cuts and J Cuts). Similarly, we repeatedly experience the sound of one scene carrying over into the image of another well beyond the edit itself, so much so that it becomes a motif, suggesting a distortion of reality. Just prior to the dog attack, the sound becomes echo-like and the picture starts to move in and out of focus, as the camera shows Faraday in a BCU, suggesting he is becoming unglued from his environment. This also happens later on with Roderick, just prior to the fire. Perhaps the most interesting scene from an aural perspective is the scene in the nursery near the end of the film. As Angela examines the room, the distorted and difficult to identify sound becomes unrelenting (it is easily the loudest scene in the film). However, as the other characters run through the house towards the noise, all sound is pulled out almost entirely, with only the barest hint of footfalls detectable. This is extremely jarring and extremely effective, working to emphasise the dread all of the characters are by now feeling.

However, beyond that, this just did nothing for me; there was nothing I could get my teeth into, I didn't care about any of the characters beyond the first half hour, the social commentary was insipid and said nothing of interest, the supernatural aspects are so underplayed as to be virtually invisible, and, most unforgivably, the film is terminally boring.

Unlike any gangster/drug movie you've ever seen, _Pájaros de verano_ [_Birds of Passage_] is from the same team that made the astonishing _El abrazo de la serpiente_ [_Embrace of the Serpent_] (2015), and presents a thematically similar narrative, looking at the disintegration of an ancient indigenous culture over a period of years. However, whereas _Abrazo_ depicted an Amazonian civilisation corrupted by the West, _Pájaros_ deals with the Wayúu people of the Guajira Peninsula in northern Colombia, whose traditions and way of life are decimated by the marijuana trade during the 1970s. Written by Maria Camila Arias and Jacques Toulemonde Vidal from a story by Cristina Gallego, and directed by Gallego and Ciro Guerra (the married couple who produced and directed _Abrazo_, respectively, and who got divorced during the filming of _Pájaros_), the film spans a 13-year period from 1968 to 1981, during which time the importance of practising sacred rituals is replaced with stories and myths about the importance of practising sacred rituals.

Thematically focused on the clash between ancient tradition and modern greed, the film is deeply respectful of the Wayúu, with Gallego and Guerra clearly troubled by the cultural losses concomitant with monetary prosperity. In this sense, the film is partly an ethnographic study that tasks itself with preserving as much as it can of Wayúu tradition, and partly a genre film depicting the rise and fall of a drug kingpin _á la_ Brian de Palma's _Scarface_ (1983). Allowing genre to inform anthropology and anthropology to enrich genre, _Pájaros_ strikes a broadly successful balance throughout, resulting in a film that consistently depicts familiar genre tropes in a manner which audiences will find unique, especially those whose only familiarity with this _milieu_ comes from shows like _Drug Wars_ (1990-1992) and _Narcos_ (2015-2017), and Americentrist films such as Ted Demme's _Blow_ (2001), Brad Furman's _The Infiltrator_ (2016), and Doug Liman's _American Made_ (2017). On paper, it could be dismissed as just another gangster film, and although their adherence to the genre template does occasionally work against the story they're trying to tell, Gallego and Guerra have made a beautifully nuanced, aesthetically exceptional, and deeply lamentative film.

Loosely based on a true story, and divided into five sections - ""Canto I: Wild Grass"" (1968), ""Canto II: The Graves"" (1971), ""Canto III: Prosperity"" (1979), ""Canto IV: The War"" (1980), and ""Canto V: Limbo"" (1981) - _Pájaros_ opens in a Wayúu village in 1968, with a ceremony celebrating the coming of age of Zaida Pushaina (Natalia Reyes). Under the tutelage of her mother Úrsula (Carmiña Martínez), Zaida has spent the last year in confinement, as is Wayúu tradition, learning handicrafts such as knitting and weaving. The ceremony also doubles as a courtship ritual, with Rapayet (José Acosta) making a claim on Zaida. However, as a small trader of coffee and liquor, he is considered Zaida's social inferior, and was only at the ceremony because his uncle Peregrino (José Vicente Cote) is a ""_pütchipü'ü_"" [word messenger]; a vital figure in Wayúu culture who objectively mediates between disputing parties. Hoping to put Rapayet off her daughter, Úrsula assigns him a dowry far beyond his means - thirty goats, twenty cows, two sacred necklaces, and two decorative mules. Desperate to marry Zaida, however, Rapayet seizes on something suggested by his business partner, Moisés (Jhon Narváez), a non-Wayúu who has pointed out that the local American Peace Corp are looking for someone to buy weed from to bring it back to the US. Selling them the marijuana grown on the remote and heavily-guarded farm owned by his cousin Aníbal (Juan Bautista Martínez), Rapayet is not especially bothered that such illegal trade is frowned upon by the Wayúu, and he quickly makes enough money to secure the dowry, marrying Zaida, and eagerly embracing his new-found _parvenu_ status within the community. By the time we reach Canto II in 1971, Rapayet and the increasingly hot-headed and reckless Moisés are working with a large importer/exporter, flying planeloads of weed across the border, and making so much money they have to weigh it rather than count it. However, as time passes, and the business becomes bigger and bigger, the Wayúu begin to resent the presence of so many ""_alijuna_"" [outsiders] who have no respect for their traditions or culture. Working as his advisor, Úrsula warns Rapayet to tread carefully, but as the profit continues to escalate, so too do the tensions between the various players, compounded by Úrsula's cruel and uncontrollable son Leonídas (Greider Meza), who has grown up amidst corruption, decadence, and amorality, and who has no time for Wayúu tradition. When he commits a hideous crime, verbal disagreements quickly turn into tit-for-tat violence, and that violence threatens a war that could destroy the Wayúu entirely.

Historically, _Pájaros_ touches on four periods of huge national significance in Colombia; it begins ten years after _La Violencia_ [1948-1958], a civil war fought between the _Partido Conservador Colombiano_ [Colombian Conservative Party] and the _Partido Liberal Colombiano_ [Colombian Liberal Party], and four years after the commencement of the ""Colombian Conflict"", an unnamed low-intensity civil war fought between multiple groups that is ongoing today; Canto III, Canto IV, and Canto V are set during the years of the _Bonanza Marimbera_ [1975-1985], when drug trafficking first soared; and the film ends just prior to the ascension of Pablo Escobar in 1982. That _Pájaros_ is aiming for a grand, folkloric tale of national significance, along the same lines as more traditional Colombian myths such as _La Llorona_ or _El Mohan_, is seen in the fact that it both begins and ends with a blind bard (Sergio Coen) narrating the events; telling us this is a story of ""_love and desolation, wealth and pain_"" and it depicts ""_how a great family destroyed itself_"". Taken directly from the Homeric tradition, the presence of this figure immediately indicates the kind of story this is. Structurally and in terms of characterisation, the film evokes Francis Ford Coppola's _The Godfather_ (1972) - it opens with a prolonged celebration, and regularly features scenes of people eating, as well as social events; Rapayet is a Michael Corleone figure, a good man corrupted by his own success; Moisés is a mixture of the sybaritism of Fredo and the volatile unpredictability of Sonny; Úrsula recalls the scepticism of Kay Adams and the wisdom of Carmela; Aníbal is Virgil Sollozzo, antagonistic and convinced of the strength of his position; Leonídas is Carlo Rizzi, unconcerned with honour or tradition, who looks down on everyone around him. Additionally, the _dénouement_ unmistakably has something of a _Scarface_ vibe about it.

Aesthetically, although not as striking as the extraordinary _El abrazo de la serpiente_, _Pájaros_ still looks fantastic. Cinematographer David Gallego really captures the colourful essence of the Wayúu with his rich and textured photography and striking compositions. He also does a fantastic job in his depiction of the vast openness of the desert, with exquisitely composed shots that make full use of the 2.35:1 format. Characters are often dwarfed by the immensity of the desert background, as if their transient existence is insignificant in the face of nature, which, of course, it is. In terms of performances, Carmiña Martínez is the standout. Born in Guajira and with Wayúu roots, she plays Úrsula with an extraordinary degree of depth and gravitas, as someone used to being in a position of authority, and not having that authority questioned. However, even she realises she is out of her depth in Rapayet's drug smuggling, and Martínez taps into the similarities between Úrsula and the queen in any number of Greek tragedies, someone whose beliefs are grounded in ethics, but who is on a preordained path of tragedy from which she cannot escape. And just as the gods were indifferent to the suffering of Euripides's Medea and Sophocles's Electra, so too are the deities of the Wayúu.

Throughout the film, the economy of Gallego and Guerra's visual language is striking. For example, early on, Rapayet, Zaida, and Úrsula are all shown living in small thatched huts made of stone and wood. Later, however, they live in in a heavily guarded sprawling modernist mansion in the middle of the desert, where anyone approaching the house can be seen for miles off. For them, the house symbolises their success. For the audience, however, it's a symbol of the crass absurdity of their opulence. Another example is that, initially, we see Rapayet and Moisés using only one plane to carry their weed, but later, there is a fleet of planes at their command, telling us in one shot how much the scale of their operation has increased. Tied into this is that in the early parts of the film, people trade and negotiate via goats, but by the half-way point, people are paying one another with crates of automatic weapons.

Speaking of aesthetics, although they remain within the parameters of the crime drama, depicting the rise and fall of a gangster, Guerra and Gallego are more concerned with the impact of the drug trade on the Wayúu than the drug trade itself. Uninterested in going into detail about the logistics of Rapayet's operation, there's no montage of planes being loaded with hemp, no tension-filled scenes of interfering law enforcement, no scenes of excessive hedonism based on the spoils of the trade (although Moisés does like a good party). Instead, they use the genre template as a platform from which to examine the clash between the ancient local traditions of the Wayúu and the ubiquitous and corruptive nature of monetary accruement as found in the twentieth-century world at large. The Wayúu are proud of how deep their customs run and how long they have maintained them, pointing out they've survived encounters with the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and various modern-day Colombian governments. However, their nonconformist and isolationist ideology has never faced anything as insidious as the avarice introduced by Rapayet.

Just how corruptive it is, is seen in Leonídas, a boy who takes wealth for granted and who has never wanted for anything. Thus, he has no respect for anything or anyone - his very soul is built on Mammonism and everything he does is based on entitlement, with the culture of the Wayúu powerless to combat such a person. In perhaps the film's most disturbing scene, after being chastised for his behaviour by Rapayet, Leonídas ""proves"" his manhood by telling a poor man that if he eats a piece of dog faeces, he will give him a wad of bills. At first, the man refuses, but temptation takes over, and he forces himself to eat the excrement, as Leonídas looks on and laughs, subsequently throwing the money at the vomiting man. Nothing in Wayúu history has ever prepared them for this level of barbarism.

In this sense, much as was _Abrazo_, where indigenous cultures were corrupted by (often well-meaning) western explorers and missionaries, _Pájaros_ is fundamentally about the clash between tradition and modernity; an exchange-based economy built upon codes of honour and reciprocity destroyed by greed, materialism, and an ever-escalating series of violent reprisals and deepening mistrust. In depicting the society before the birth of the drug trade, however, Gallego and Guerra are trying to reclaim Colombia's history for Colombians. The _Bonanza Marimbera_ and the years of Pablo Escobar are all a lot of people know about the country, with their knowledge coming from films made almost exclusively by non-Colombians for non-Colombians. In interviews, the directors have expressed distaste with the glorification of Escobar, the fact that he has been turned into a folk hero of sorts; Gallego has spoken about how it pains her to see people come to the country wearing t-shirts with Escobar's face on them, whilst even Escobar's own son has spoken out against _Narcos_, arguing the show glamorises the drug trade. Gallego and Guerra argue that an entire generation of indigenous people have been forgotten about, a people who were laid waste by the years of excess during the _Bonanza_ and the horrific violence of the Escobar years.

Trying to commit as much of the Wayúu culture as they can to film in an effort to preserve it, they are thus performing an anthropological service; the film is about the importance of cultural memory, but so too is it a part of that memory. Throughout, we are immersed in Wayúu culture, and Gallego and Guerra don't need to go into detail about the ins and outs of dream analysis, the complex systems of hegemony and protocol, the exchange-based economy, or the specifics of why one necklace is sacred but another is not. We're shown enough to understand how these people live - the centrality of family, the respect for the natural world, the reverence for the dead, the significance of communal ritual, the importance of ancient customs and superstitions. Above all, however, their primary value in all things is honour, which is why Rapayet getting involved in drug smuggling is so controversial for the village. Indeed, at one point he is told, ""_you no longer act as Wayúu, you act like alijuna_""; one of the deepest insults imaginable in this _milieu_, driving home that, yes, he may be making money, but he has lost his cultural soul in the process.

The film makes its intentions known in the opening scene, which is built around Zaida's ceremony, just as _The Godfather_ indicates its main focus with the opening depiction of a wedding. Without any dialogue, the scene establishes the socio-political centrality of ritual in Wayúu society and introduces us to the social hierarchies and spiritual beliefs. This opening scene is contrasted with a later scene depicting a ""_second burial_""; a custom where a casket is unearthed and opened, and the bones of the deceased cleaned and reburied. In this scene, although the importance of the ritual is just as paramount as in the opening, unlike in that scene, this ritual is surrounded by men armed with machine guns; a brilliant bit of cinematic shorthand to show us how much has changed. In another example, after doing something to anger a rival clan, Leonídas is hidden away in a hut, and Úrsula performs a protective incantation. Leonídas, however, is unimpressed, saying he'd be happier if he was surrounded by men with guns. Elsewhere, a motif running through the film is the threat of a locust infestation, and when violence inevitably erupts, it's presented like a plague on the land, something that cannot be contained and that will blight all it touches.

In terms of problems, there are a few. For one, Rapayet is an extremely stoic character, about as forceful as Fredo Corleone, and very vaguely defined. In this sense, he doesn't really come across as a person with an interiority, so rather than being someone who pursues things, he is someone to whom things happen, a cypher at the mercy of what the writers need him to be at any given moment. Because of this, he doesn't really have much of an arc - he's essentially the same person as a drug lord as he was when he traded coffee and liquor. Along these lines, Zaida fares even worse. Despite the opening scene suggesting her centrality to the narrative, once she and Rapayet are married, she essentially becomes a background extra, having next-to-nothing to do as Rapayet and Úrsula dominate proceedings. Additionally, at times, the demands of the genre do impinge somewhat on the narrative, with an action scene late in the film feeling out of place (although to be fair, the way it's shot makes up for the scene itself feeling fairly rote).

These few issues notwithstanding, _Pájaros de verano_ is an exceptional film, and, off the top of my head, I can't think of another movie which captured the clash between the old and new worlds quite as powerfully, with the possible exception of Terrence Malick's _The New World_ (2005). A melancholy corrective to Fernando León de Aranoa's _Loving Pablo_ (2017), Pájaros tells a story of a traditional culture decimated by greed. Making a powerful statement about what has been lost, by and large, Gallego and Guerra handle the integration of ethnographic study and genre film very well, with the movie as a whole serving as an excellent example of how talented filmmakers can use genre to serve their own thematic ends without necessarily making a genre film. Neither a thriller with some local details thrown on top nor a documentary with a manufactured dramatic structure, _Pájaros_ is compelling and heartfelt throughout. The film's sense of detail, its cultural specificity, and the tragic inevitability of the story it tells serve to fuse the socio-political, the ethnographic, and the thriller into a whole that is unlike any drug film you're likely to see.,‘Birds of Passage’ feels like a gangster epic anchored by a people seeing their world view slowly slipping from their sight. It manages to make a narco narrative feel new and visually stunning on a broad dreamlike canvas, taking a creaky old Hollywood genre and moulding it into something altogether more entrancing.

- Camille Vidal-Naquet; _Sauvage_ Production Notes

_Sauvage_ [trans. _Wild_, although a lot of reviewers are incorrectly calling it _Savage_] is the debut film of writer/director Camille Vidal-Naquet, a former professor of film studies, and takes as its subject the daily grind of a male prostitute. Depictions of prostitution in cinema have something of a chequered history; the best known are probably Luis Buñuel's _Belle de Jour_ (1967), which is more interested in female sexual desire than the specifics of prostitution itself, Garry Marshall's _Pretty Woman_ (1990), and Woody Allen's _Mighty Aphrodite_ (1995), both of which are fantastical and utterly divorced from reality. Thus far, it has been the province of smaller films to look at sex workers with anything approaching realism - Keren Yedaya's _Or (My Treasure)_ (2005), Megan Griffiths's _Eden_ (2013), David Pablos's _Las elegidas_ (2015), and, especially, the seismic gut punch that is Lukas Moodysson's _Lilja 4-Ever_ (2002), which is more about sex slavery, but which does deal with the reality of prostitution.

In _Sauvage_, Vidal-Naquet strikes a delicate balance between misery porn and objectively delineating the day-to-day of being a sex worker (a balance not found in _Lilja 4-ever_). The film is undeniably bleak, but it's not what you would define as miserablism. Remaining detached from what it depicts, it adopts a clinically dispassionate approach, one that remains always non-judgemental. Intermixing the degrading reality of selling one's self with unexpected moments of tenderness and warmth, Vidal-Naquet taps into something deeply compelling. Some will be put off by the (very) graphic sex scenes, the passivity of the main character, or the lack of much of a plot. However, for everyone else, although it certainly isn't multiplex fare, there's a hell of a lot to admire here.

Set in Strasbourg, _Sauvage_ tells the story of Léo (an extraordinarily committed performance from relative newcomer Félix Maritaud), a homeless, drug-addicted male prostitute, whose name, like those of his fellow sex workers, is never spoken in the film (the names come from the press kit). Surviving mainly by drinking from gutters and eating what he can steal and what he can find in bins, as the film begins, Léo is attending a doctor (Lionel Riou), revealing bruises, a split lip, a nasty cough, and stomach pains. Upon examining him, the doctor appears to begin sexually molesting him. However, all is not as it seems in the scene, which is a genius way to open the movie. It soon becomes clear that Léo is a little different from his fellow prostitutes; he's laidback, he seems to enjoy sleeping under the stars, he has no great desire to pursue a better life, he kisses his clients when he feels like it (unlike the others, who all have a no kissing rule), and he treats each sexual encounter as a moment of physical and psychological intimacy, rather than simply a monetary transaction. The episodic narrative follows Léo from one sexual encounter to the next, occasionally focusing on his relationship with gay-for-pay prostitute Ahd (Éric Bernard), with whom he is in love. Within this general framework, we see a wheelchair-bound man (Lucas Bléger) who can only get an erection when he pays for sex; an elderly book-seller (Jean-Pierre Basté), who simply wants Léo to read to him, and who, upon finding out Léo can't read, is content for them to lie in bed holding one another; a heavily pierced couple (Nicholas Fernandez and Nicholas Chalumeau) who treat Léo like a piece of meat; a kindly fellow prostitute, Mihal (Nicholas Dibla), who seems romantically interested in Léo; a notoriously sadistic client known as ""The Pianist"" (Jean-François-Charles Martin) about whom Ahd warns Léo; and a respectable middle-aged man, Claude (Philippe Ohrel), who has never had a homosexual experience. A truly beautiful scene occurs when Léo attends a female doctor (Marie Seux); treating him with respect and empathy, when she attempts to examine him, he hugs her, and they hold each other for a moment, in an embrace that has nothing to do with sexuality and everything to do with kindness and emotional support. It's a devastatingly tender moment, flawlessly written, shot, and acted.

In preparation for making the film, Vidal-Naquet joined an outreach charity as a way to meet young male prostitutes at the Bois de Boulogne (a well-known location for prostitution in Paris). Intending to go on only a few runs over the course of a couple of weeks, he ended up spending three years visiting the spot, and formed strong friendships with several of the men, all the while refining the script to make it as true to life as possible (all of Léo's sexual encounters in the film come from stories told to him by the actual sex workers). In writing the character of Léo, Vidal-Naquet was influenced by Agnès Varda's _Sans toit ni loi_ (1985), in which Sandrine Bonnaire plays a young homeless woman without a past, and Stuart Rosenberg's _Cool Hand Luke_ (1967), in which Paul Newman plays a character who never loses hope despite enduring great hardships, and whose optimism proves to be his most resilient characteristic. He also had Maritaud watch films such as Amos Kollek's _Sue Lost in Manhattan_ (1998) and Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne's _Rosetta_ (1999). For the graphic sex scenes, Vidal-Naquet took inspiration from Paul Verhoeven's _Turks fruit_ (1973) and, bizarrely, _Showgirls_ (1995), explaining,

> _I have always been impressed with the way Verhoeven directed his actors and managed to convey that sense of shamelessness and automatic freedom of the body._

Vidal-Naquet describes Léo as

> _a solitary young man who hits the road and wanders from one encounter to the next, longing for love, driven by an unquenchable capacity for love that keeps him going, regardless of the violent world around him._

The film reveals nothing about Léo's background - where he comes from, how he became a prostitute, does he have any family - and many of the choices he makes prompt more questions than answers, with much of what he does tied to his notions of personal freedom. Even his final choice, which is undeniably selfish and ill-advised, is consistent with the psychology of the character as seen up to that point. He isn't especially interested in a life away from drugs and prostitution, and so he takes the violence, degradations, and humiliations, because every now and then he meets someone who provides him with a degree of transitory happiness. And that is his primary concern, rather than the practicalities about which his colleagues worry; when asked by the female doctor if he wants to quit drugs, he replies, ""_what for?_"", and when Mihal offers him a mobile phone, he seems genuinely bemused, asking, ""_who would I call?_"" Even his attitude to hygiene is questionable - we never once see him taking a shower, his clothes are perpetually filthy, he drinks from gutters and eats from bins, he has a litany of physical ailments, and on two occasions, other characters comment that he smells bad. Even the money he earns from selling himself doesn't seem to be especially important, as he appears to use it primarily for tattoos and drugs.

Léo doesn't share in the detachment, coldness, or bitterness of his fellow prostitutes, all of whom find it bizarre that he's willing to kiss clients, and several of whom find it unprofessional. However, the important point is that Léo doesn't kiss on-demand, he does so only when it feels right. This in and of itself illustrates how different he is from the other prostitutes, and how selling himself is not exclusively monetary - he is searching for genuine affection, and he seems incapable of establishing the same boundaries between himself and his clients as the other sex workers live by. He gives much more of himself than them, in the hopes of establishing a genuine human connection with someone. Indeed, Ahd says at one point, ""_it's like you enjoy being a whore_"", which he doesn't deny.

His fellow prostitutes are healthier, cleaner, more financially independent, more aware of the dangers of their occupation, never allowing emotions to become involved. But Léo is far more tender than any of them, and for all the harshness of his life, there is something Emersonian about him. Indeed, for much of the film, he has a pseudo- transcendentalist soul - he is relatively free of the norms of society and its institutions; he is at peace in and with nature; he lives very much in the moment; he has almost no materialist needs whatsoever; he trusts completely in his own instincts, he never lets go of his hope of finding love. Ahd advises him to ""_find yourself an old man. A nice one. It's the best that can happen to us_"", and Ahd himself has a semi-regular wealthy sugar daddy (Joël Villy) who wants to make their arrangement permanent. Léo, however, wants more than that. This is why the scene with the female doctor is so beautiful and so heartbreaking - when she treats him with respect and shows genuine concern for his wellbeing, he instinctively grabs at the human connection, irrespective of her gender (she's actually the only female in the film). That she allows him to hold her speaks volumes for her understanding of who he is, and the scene is perhaps the one where Léo is most clearly laid bare.

Obviously, for a film of this nature to be in any way realistic, it must depict sexuality, and Vidal-Naquet doesn't hold back on that front. At the screening I attended, five people walked out within the first half-hour, by which time there had already been three graphic sex scenes (including a threesome with two prostitutes and a disabled man in a wheelchair). What's interesting about these scenes, however, is that they never lose their potency, irrespective of how many we see. I think the reason for this is how Vidal-Naquet presents them; far from filming them in a voyeuristic way or as titillation, they are instead presented dispassionately as something that happens to people in this line of work, as normal for Léo as taking drugs or sleeping rough - it's simply a part of his life.

Cinematographer Jacques Girault employs a pseudo-documentarian _cinéma vérité_ aesthetic; the entire film is shot handheld, with an occasional loss of focus, frequent awkward compositions, and even losing the subject momentarily in the frame before picking him up again. This has the effect of neither demonising sexuality as something perverted and dirty, nor valorising it as the most important part of a relationship. By depicting it as simply a part of Léo's life, Vidal-Naquet normalises it, not just in terms of it being sexual activity, but also in terms of it being homosexual and in terms of it being sex work. He certainly doesn't gloss over the problems of this kind of life, or the sexual perversions one may encounter (represented by Léo's experiences with the pierced couple and The Pianist), but he doesn't present sex work as, in and of itself, fundamentally immoral.

Instead, he depicts both sides of the coin; the physical non-sexual intimacy with the elderly bookseller who simply wants someone to read to him and the demeaning threesome with the pierced couple who have Léo stand naked in front of them as they discuss how bad he smells, before roughly using a sex toy that would make even the ladies of LegalPorno.com winch. Indeed, Vidal-Naquet gets his point across about the highs and lows of sex work with a very simple edit - the film cuts from Léo lying peacefully in bed with the bookseller to giving a rough blowjob to a client in a car parked in an alley.

In terms of problems, as already stated, many will find the graphic sex scenes too much. Another issue is that Léo is an extremely passive character; he doesn't so much drive the plot as the plot depicts things that happen to him. Coupled with this, he doesn't have much of an arc, and at the end, he isn't overly different from the man we met at the beginning. With him being in every scene, almost every shot, the other prostitutes are very thinly sketched (even Ahd and Mihal), but this is by design. On the other hand, the depiction of Claude, the magnanimous and kindly middle-aged man who takes a liking to Léo and immediately opens his home to him, is open to criticism; in a film founded on realism, he is something of a _deus ex-machina_, arriving in Léo's life just as he reaches his lowest point.

On paper, _Sauvage_ should be a textbook case of misery porn, following as it does a homeless drug-addicted male prostitute and his often demeaning sexual encounters. However, Vidal-Naquet's non-judgemental depiction of Léo's occupation and _milieu_ allows the more optimistic elements of his personality to rise to the surface, even in the face of seemingly endless degradations. It's certainly not an easy watch, but amidst the depravity, Vidal-Naquet finds moments of tenderness (the bookseller, the female doctor, Mihal, Claude), moments which mean everything to Léo. Uninterested in titillation, the film depicts sexual activity as something that happens, without judgement or commentary. And by so doing, it avoids, for the most part, the clichés so inherent to films dealing with prostitution. Neither condemning Léo's lifestyle nor valorising it, no matter how demeaning or brutal it becomes, he always seems to find a way to keep going. That may be interpreted as tragic, but that's not the way Léo looks at himself, nor is it the way Vidal-Naquet wants us to look at him.,","hustler,male prostitute,gay sex,lgbt,strasbourg,",9,5,"Camille Vidal-Naquet,"

Somehow, no other_ _rhythms in reggae seemed to swing as perfectly as a Studio One rhythm._

- Victor Headley; _Yardie_ (1992)

_Yardie_ is the directorial debut of Idris Elba, and is about as pedestrian a film as you're likely to see all year; a listless gangland-based drama composed of a litany of gangster-film clichés. There are a couple of elements worth praising, and it's competently directed, but by and large, it's extremely shallow, containing nothing you haven't seen in half a dozen other films. I wish it wasn't so; I'm a big Elba fan (who isn't), but, let's face it, a lot of his post-Stringer Bell acting work has been poor, to say the least – Guy Ritchie's _RockNRolla_ (2008), David S. Goyer's _The Unborn_ (2009), Ridley Scott's _Prometheus_ (2012), Sam Miller's _No Good Deed_ (2014), James Watkins's _Bastille Day_ (2016), Nikolaj Arcel's _The Dark Tower_ (2017); hardly an impressive CV. Still though, for his first film in the director's chair, I was hopeful he might chose a project with a little more care than he seems to be choosing his acting roles. And whilst he certainly seems to have settled on something personal, a story with whose _milieu_ he is already familiar, the film is populated by generic characters, themes, and narrative beats; at best, it's fitfully interesting, at worst, it doesn't work at all, plodding along at its own imprecise pace, getting nowhere fast. And then it ends.

Based on Victor Headley's 1992 novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Headley, Brock Norman Brock (_Bronson_) and Martin Stellman (_Quadrophenia_; _The Interpreter_), the film begins in Kingston, Jamaica in 1973, a town in the midst of a bloody gang-war. Sick of the violence, local man Jerry Dread (Everaldo Creary) decides to stage an impromptu block-party in the no man's land between each gang's territory (_détente_ by reggae, if you will). All is going well, with Jerry even coaxing the two rival kingpins up on stage to shake hands. However, a youth in the crowd shoots Jerry dead, leaving his kid brother, D, distraught. At the subsequent Nine-Nights, D refuses to bless Jerry's journey into the afterlife, which tradition says will prevent the spirit from being able to move on, and sure enough, shortly thereafter, D begins to imagine he is being watched by Jerry's ghost. Ten years later, D (Aml Ameen) has worked his way up the ranks of music producer/drug lord King Fox (Sheldon Shepherd), who was also one of the men onstage when Jerry was killed. However, Fox regards D as too much of a ""_mad dog_"", and so packs him off to Hackney, London, with a kilo of coke to be delivered to Fox's London connection, Rico (Stephen Graham). D is only too happy to go, as his childhood sweetheart, Yvonne (Shantol Jackson) relocated to London several years earlier with their daughter, and they've been estranged ever since. However, upon meeting Rico, he and D rub each other up the wrong way, and D flees with the cocaine, later teaming up with a sound clash crew who know a Turk willing to sell D's drugs. Meanwhile, D attempts to reconnect with Yvonne and his daughter, learns Jerry's killer may be in London, and is unhappy to learn Fox is coming to the city to sort out the situation between D and Rico personally.

The term ""yardie"" has something of a double meaning; within the Jamaican diaspora, it tends to describe those who were actually born in Jamaica. However, outside the Caribbean, it tends to refer to organised Jamaican gangs operating on foreign soil, especially the UK. Coming from the Patois ""yard"", which can mean ""home"", the term carries both a hint of condemnation aimed at the crime gangs who swear they love their country whilst shaming it with their actions, but also a sense of national pride, a desire to establish a connective tissue with the motherland. And it's in relation to nationality and ethnic identity that _Yardie_ is at its strongest – the film does a truly excellent job of evoking not only a time and place, but a whole subculture.

Pretty much everything looks completely authentic, almost documentarian (it probably helps that Elba himself was born in Hackney, later working as a DJ, whilst most of the cast are either Jamaican or of Jamaican lineage. Even Stephen Graham's paternal grandfather was Jamaican). Similarly, the soundtrack isn't simply representative of monolithic 70s/80s, but actually gives the film its rhythm, with Elba choosing songs of great cultural significance – tracks such as Lord Creator's ""Kingston Town"" (1970), The Isley Brothers' ""Work to Do"" (1972), Max Romeo & The Upsetters' ""War Ina Babylon"" (1976), Skip Marley's 2018 cover of his grandfather's ""Johnny Was"" (1976), Black Uhura's ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1979), and Grace Jones's ""My Jamaican Guy"" (1983). Speaking to the _Hollywood Reporter_ at Sundance, Elba says of the soundtrack,

> _the music carries a message, and also gives a vibe. Especially in the 80s in London, we revisit the club scene there, and it was really important to me, because that's where I discovered myself as a DJ, it was really important to me that the audience feel like they have just left the club in those scenes._

This sense of authenticity is carried into an aspect of the film with which I'm sure a lot of people will have problems – the dialogue is delivered entirely in heavy Pathois, without any subtitles. Personally, I think this is an admirable decision; nothing takes you out of a film quicker than English subtitles for spoken English (I'm thinking of something like Neil Blomkamp's _Chappie_). And although there is no doubt that it's hard to understand some of what is said, and a few of the character beats are probably lost as a result, David Ehrlich's ludicrous assertion that ""_40% of the movie is unintelligible_"" in his damning _IndieWire_ review is absolute rubbish. He criticises the film for being ""_needlessly difficult_"" due to the lack of subtitles, apparently not considering that this is genuinely the accent with which these people speak, and we're quick to judge films that mangle dialects. It's really no different from seeing an English Renaissance play or reading Chaucer – once you acclimate yourself to it, there shouldn't be any major problems. According to Elba,

> _I was super aware I was asking an audience that aren't familiar with the accent to really listen. But what's come from that is that people feel like they've just taken a real authentic journey into a place they didn't know too much about._

It's not just the aural design that is excellent – the visual tapestry really evokes place and culture too, as Elba does a fine job of indoctrinating the viewer into the cadences of the culture, capturing the period details of early 1980s Hackney with the eye of someone who lived there. This aspect of authenticity is matched in the props; according to production designer Damien Creagh almost nothing was custom made for the film, with the vast majority of props being working examples of the period. Of this sense of visual authenticity, speaking to _IndieWire_, Elba states,

> _The main thing that I spoke to the entire cast about was authenticity, everyone from the lead down to the last extra. Authenticity of thought; my thing was always say, ""don't lie to the camera, be honest in the moment. If you're not feeling it, don't do it, because it will come across as a lie, and fake""._

Unfortunately, however, ""the film does a truly excellent job of evoking not only a time and place, but a whole subculture"" is about the only praise I can give, because the rest of the film is extremely poor. Where to begin? Firstly, we've seen this film before, dozens of times – the gangster with a heart of gold wrestling with his loyalty and his desire to go straight, with only the love of a good woman to help guide him – and there's not an original character in the mix, with every single one of the principal cast (with the possible exception of Rico) coming across like they've been assembled from a ""make your own"" movie clichés modelling kit. The directionless plot also displays no real sense of dramatic intent, jumping from one thing to the next, often with little causality linking the two; it's more a collection of tentatively related scenes than a coherent narrative.

The use of voiceover is also troubling. Highly didactic and explanatory, it says nothing that can't be gleaned by simply watching the film. Voiceovers giving beat-by-beat summaries of a narrative (think the original cut of Ridley Scott's _Blade Runner_) are always a bad idea. The only style of voiceovers that work are the more esoteric kind used by Terrence Malick, or ones which set up a direct contrast with what we're seeing. This is neither.

The problem is, simply put, that the narrative is so much weaker than the milieu containing it. Certainly not a problem exclusive to this film (if you've seen anything Ridley Scott has done post-_Gladiator_ (2000), you're already familiar with this issue), but it's especially pronounced here because a) the narrative is so derivative, and b) the milieu is so strongly evoked. The film is too enamoured with the tropes of the gangster movie to work as a genre subversion, nor is it pulpy enough to be enjoyed for its excess, à la something like Brian De Palma's _Scarface_ (1983) or Peter Medak's _Romeo is Bleeding_ (1993). It occupies this inoffensive, vanilla middle ground, not really doing a huge amount wrong, but not really doing a huge amount right either.,","london, england,based on novel or book,gangster,jamaica,organized crime,car chase,kingston, jamaica,",34,17,"Idris Elba,"

Both directed by Jon Knautz, ""The Cleaning Lady"" tells the story of 'Shelly' (Rachel Alig), who becomes the cleaning lady for 'Alice' (Alexis Kendra). 'Shelly's face is terribly scarred and at first the introverted woman barely speaks, avoids eye contact and and her personality stands in a total contrast to 'Alice', who does makeup work for a living. 'Alice' fell terribly in love with 'Michael' (Stelio Savante), a married man. Knowing that this relationship is kind of toxic, she attends to a self help group, 'The Love Addicts' (same thing as the AA, just for the relationship thing), and the movie takes a while to get going. A little too long, because first this film feels a lot like a low budget drama and aside from the opening, where you see 'Shelly' putting rats into a blender, there is nothing horrifying going on for quite some time. So long, that you actually get bored with the film. We see the two women meet up for scheduled cleaning appointments, in between we get the relationship going back and forth and a deeper look into the childhood of 'Shelly', filled with abuse by her mother, scenes where they just sit down for dinner, doing makeup together... Boring stuff for the most part. When things finally get going, ""The Cleaning Lady"" turns into the Horror movie I was waiting for though, and I really liked how things played out. Unfortunately it took so long to get there, that I can't really call it a good film anymore. It is watchable and there are quite a few nice scenes if you have the patience to sit through the long intro, but if you don't, ""The Cleaning Lady"" might not be for you. The acting is fine and the burned skin effects look very convincing (especially if you seen what a beauty Rachel Alig actually is) and for this being an extension of a short film, it wasn't bad at all. But at least a little excitement during the first 30 to 40 minutes would have been nice.,_You're perfect now._

This movie will make you feel for Shelly and Alice in different ways.

The slow pace of this works well cause it isn't something that can't be pushed quickly to the surface.

Scars, both physical and mental, can run deep and the director shows this with the two women well.

Also, damn Shelly has a backstory. Her mother is the worst.

Pairing this with _Single White Female (1992) or Audition (1999)_ would make for a good double feature of a thriller viewing.,",,11,32,"Jon Knautz,"

Seasoned international correspondents compare the city of Слов'я́нськ [Slovyansk] with Чечня́ [Chechnya]. According to them, things are looking exactly like they did just before the Пе́рвая чече́нская война́ [first Chechen conflict] ensued: blocked streets, trucks parked across the roads, militant groups on the streets.As the death toll climbs, there's no sign that separatists intend stopping any time soon. When asked about their goals and objectives, all as one are firm: ""we'll stand until the end"". And to most of them, that end means separation from Ukraine._

- ""Who's Behind Separatism in the Donbass?"" (Denys Kazanskyi); The _Ukrainian Week_ (May 1, 2014)

>_The action of the film takes place in the Donbass, a region of Eastern Ukraine, occupied by various criminal gangs. The fighting is going on between the Сухопутні Війська [Ukrainian regular army], supported by volunteers, and separatist gangs, supported by Russian troops. It is a hybrid war, happening alongside an open armed conflict, accompanied by killings and robberies on a mass scale, and a gradual degradation of the civilian population. There is fear, deception, hatred and violence everywhere. The society is collapsing, and death and deadly silence lie upon the place._

- Sergei Loznitsa; Director's Statement; _Donbass_ Production Notes

In an era of fake news and alternative facts, when the public's familiarity with far-flung military engagements derives as much from civilian smartphones as it does from on-the-front-line reports for CNN or _The New York Times_, and where mass falsehoods promulgate like wildfire via questionable sources on social media, control of propaganda has become a key component of modern warfare. Focusing on the conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukranian loyalists and Russian-backed separatists, writer/director Sergei Loznitsa (_Счастье мое_ [_My Joy_]; _Событие_ [_The Event_]; _Лагідна_ [_A Gentle Creature_]) adopts a savagely satirical and unapologetically ironic tone in _Донбас_ [_Donbass_] as he examines the corrosive effects hateful propaganda can engender at all levels of society. Depicting an absurdist horror show that would be darkly hilarious if it wasn't so tragic, the film presents the Donbass as a pseudo-Orwellian dystopia of endemic corruption, state-sanctioned discrimination, sycophantic bureaucracy, and unashamed media manipulation. There are no heroes here; everyone is tainted, from the generals and politicians calling the shots to the soldiers on the ground to the civilians caught up in the mayhem. The lack of a standard plot and the absence of a protagonist won't be to everyone's liking, whilst the complete dearth of any geo-political contextualisation will alienate others. It's also inevitable in that in a film built on individualised vignettes, some work considerably better than others. Nevertheless, this is sobering stuff, and as timely as it is despairing.

_Donbass_ is made up of thirteen segments, each of which plays out in its entirety before we move onto the next. Relatively self-contained, the only real connection between segments is that each leads to the next via a particular character, who hands the narrative over to someone else (like a baton in a relay race). So, for example, a segment depicting a hospital administrator is followed by a segment in which that administrator is stopped at a checkpoint where a foreign journalist is being questioned about his passport and whom we follow into the next segment. And so on. No character, however, appears in more than two segments, so there's nothing even approaching a protagonist. Each segment is based on a documented real-life incident that took place in the Донецька Народна Республіка [Donetsk People's Republic] in 2014-2015, with several derived from amateur footage posted on YouTube.

The film opens with a scene in which a group of people are having makeup applied, presumably on the set of a movie or TV show. The next segment sees a woman (Olesya Zhurakovskaya) dump a bucket of faeces over a politician (Grigory Masliuk), claiming he libelled her. Next, we see Mikhalych (Boris Kamorzin), a maternity hospital administrator, proudly showing his unenthusiastic staff that the hospital is fully stocked. This is followed by events at a roadblock, including a soldier (Igor Kirilchatenko) demanding food from a bus of civilians. A German journalist (Thorsten Merten) is then interrogated at the roadblock, followed by a news report from a bomb shelter. The next scene depicts a politician (Vadim Dubovsky) half-heartedly listening to a woman (Zanna Lubgane) who wants to tour a holy relic around the region. The issue of soldiers looting is examined next, followed by a section in which Semyon (Alexander Zamurayev) learns his stolen jeep has been recovered by the military. This is followed by the film's most disturbing scene, in which a captured soldier (Valery Antoniuk) is accused of being part of a Ukrainian ""_extermination squad_"", and is tied to a pole, ridiculed, and eventually beaten by a civilian mob. A wedding scene is next, before finally, we return to the makeup trailer where we began.

Having covered the origins of the War in Donbass in documentary form in _Майдан_ [_Maidan_] (2014), Loznitsa is not especially interested in context in Donbass, partly because his point is that no amount of context can explain the absurdity of what is happening - scenes such as the captured Ukrainian soldier being abused by a mob don't acquire new meaning simply because one is familiar with the politics. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this review, a little background on the Ukrainian crisis is helpful. In November 2013, in response to President Viktor Yanukovych's U-turn regarding the signing of a Ukraine-European Union association agreement, deciding instead to establish closer ties to the Russian Federation rather than the EU, a series of demonstrations took place, collectively known as the Euromaidan movement. These protests culminated in February 2014 in a Revolution which saw the overthrow of Yanukovych. However, in response, Russian-funded anti-Revolutionary/pro-Yanukovych protests took place across east and south Ukraine, particularly in the Donbass region. These protests led to the establishment of the proto-states, Donetsk People's Republic and Луганська Народна Республіка [Luhansk People's Republic], and the proposed creation of Новоросія [Novorossiya], a confederation of the two states. The situation soon escalated into open conflict between the Russian-funded, and often Russian staffed, separatist forces, and the loyalist Ukrainian forces. As Loznitsa explains it in the film's production notes,

> _one of the main reasons for this war, which has been going on since 2014, is the collapse of the USSR. Such collapse could be followed either by a fundamental reform and complete re-organisation of the society, or by its continuous gradual decay and destruction. In this particular case, the first option after the collapse of the USSR is a gradual reform aimed at the creation of a European developmental model (with the emphasis on the rights of the individual, rule of law, and protection of private property); the second option is the return to the totalitarian Soviet mode of existence. These two options are incompatible or rather mutually exclusive. Ukraine, at least the predominant part of its population, chooses the European way, whereas Russia is rapidly moving back to the USSR. It is also important to bear in mind that the Donbass is an industrial region, which developed in the first half of the 20th century. The region was industrialised largely by employing the free labour of GULAG prisoners. Their descendants have settled in the region, having created a very peculiar community based around the factories and labour camp barracks. In recent years, especially during the rule of the former Ukrainian president Yanukovich, who was a native of the Donbass, the territory became extremely criminalised. This is why, with military and financial help from the eastern neighbour, it became possible to divide this territory between paramilitary gangs and to usurp power in the aftermath of the Maidan revolution. The war goes on because Russia provides financial and military support to the separatist movement. Its goal is very simple - to prevent Ukraine from becoming an independent state._

Obviously drawing inspiration from Elem Klimov's masterful _Иди и смотри_ [_Come and See_] (1985), one of the greatest anti-war movies ever made, Loznitsa's aesthetic mastery of the filmic medium is breath-taking. A formalist in the very best sense of the term, and working with legendary cinematographer Oleg Mutu (_Moartea domnului Lăzărescu_; _4 luni, 3 săptămîni și 2 zile_; _Zjednoczone Stany Miłosci_), Loznitsa shoots _Donbass_ in the style of _cinéma vérité_, hand-held and as unmediated as possible. For much of the film, the audience is placed in the role of an eavesdropper; we're never inculcated into the events, nor are we ever presented with the subjective perspective of a participant - instead, we watch as if this were a news report (which, in a couple of segments, it actually is). Most of the segments are shot in single-takes, which has the effect of heightening tension to almost unbearable degrees, knowing that at any moment, a bomb blast could wipe out the cast or an idiot with a gun and a grudge could open fire (during the long wedding segment, I realised I was gripping the arms of my chair so hard that my fingers were sore - simply in anticipation of...something). In this sense, Loznitsa brilliantly evokes the unpredictability of war in a manner rarely seen in films with ten times the budget.

The opening segment sets the tone brilliantly. Watching a group of people having makeup applied in a trailer, we think are on a film or TV set, but in actual fact, these people are being made up to appear in a ""factual"" news report as shell-shocked locals, complete with a director telling them what to say (basically to denounce the ""fascist"" loyalists as traitors), and a stage-managed warzone in the background. It's the very definition of fake news. This gambit immediately recalls Barry Levinson's superb _Wag the Dog_ (1997), in which a White House spin-doctor hires a Hollywood producer to ""produce"" a fake war so as to distract from a presidential sex scandal. And much like _Wag the Dog_, the comic tone with which _Donbass_ begins slowly gives way to something much darker, culminating in a deeply unsettling final scene that's as savagely ironic as anything you'll see all year.

The film's dark comedy probably reaches its zenith in the scene where Semyon heads to a military barracks because he's been told the separatist forces have recovered his stolen jeep. Believing that he will be getting the jeep back, he instead discovers that the military want him to sign the car over to them. When he refuses, he's hit with an exorbitant fine and accused of being pro-fascist. Marched into another room, he finds that room full of men, all on their phones trying to raise funds to pay the fines they too have been hit with for refusing to sign over their cars. It's like something out of Douglas Adams - a room full of be-suited middle-class men all desperately trying to do the exact same thing.

Thematically, each segment in _Donbass_ has its own target, whether it be a self-serving hospital administrator, a soldier abusing the power he has over civilians, or an uninformed mob interested only in blaming someone (anyone) for their misfortunes. No one escapes censure because no one is wholly innocent. Focusing on the misbehaviour of the separatist forces, however, accusations of fascism are everywhere – the mayor who has faeces dumped over him, the German reporter (""_if you aren't a fascist, then your grandfather was_"" yells one soldier), the civilian occupants of a bus, Semyon, a soldier who proves reluctant to loot, the captured loyalist who is tied to a pole. This last instance is especially difficult to watch. Tied up by separatist forces who actively encourage passing civilians to verbally abuse him, things soon escalate to spitting and throwing food, and, ultimately, to brutal physical assault. When some of the thugs responsible for drawing a crowd and instigating the violence against him then attend a wedding in the following segment, they amuse themselves and the guests by showing smartphone footage of the man being beaten. Mind you, this is a group of people who respond to the bride wishing that her son is born ""_with a rifle in his arms_"" by cheering, so their moral calibre isn't sky-high.

With a lack of any heroes, or even a protagonist with whom we can identify, the one tone that links the various segments is bitterness, a bitterness deeply ingrained in the souls of the people, who believe the lies they are being fed, with virtually every conversation returning in some way to issues of partisanship. One of the questions Loznitsa is asking is how one can broach reconciliation between people whose enmities run so deep. It's a question to which he has no answer; there is no kindness or compassion here. Crucially, Loznitsa is positing that the war is being fought as much with lies and propaganda as it is with weapons, and, certainly in the case of the separatist forces, amorality is simply an aspect of combat. These people are criminals as much as they are combatants, and are depicted as inherently unscrupulous, unconcerned with Ukraine or its people, even as they position themselves as the country's saviours. Indeed, Loznitsa explains,

> _Donbass is not a region, but a concept, and it became possible because the criminal relations there are the basis of life, and many people living there have no ground under their feet. And this is a problem that any government in Ukraine will have to deal with, and we, its residents, will face it every day._

In terms of problems, although Loznitsa does depict loyalist forces here and there, most of his invective is aimed at the separatists, and in this sense, the film could be accused of being unbalanced. Another issue is the lack of any political contextualisation, with no explanation of who is fighting, nor what they are fighting for, as combatants are introduced without any kind of identification. That such lack of context can hamper the film a little is illustrated in a scene where the German journalist is interviewing a group of soldiers sitting on a tank. Asking them where they are from, they all declare they are Ukrainian, from Donbass. However, the journalist's translator finds this hard to believe, the implication being that they are actually Russians. Why the presence of Russians in a so-called Ukrainian army should be important, or why the men would lie about their birthplace, is never explained. I understand what Loznitsa is trying to do here - political context is irrelevant in a conflict built on lies and absurdity - but some kind of concession to an audience not familiar with the politics would have been immensely helpful. Another issue is that because there is no central character, there is no real emotional connection. We certainly feel sympathy with some (Semyon, the soldier tied to the pole), but there is never any real pathos. Again though, this is by design.

A searing satirical portrait of a place where human interaction has devolved to a level just above barbarism, where kindness and empathy are signs of weakness, in the post-truth politics of _Donbass_, horror, violence, abuses of power, Orwellian propagation (and acceptance) of fake news, and war hysteria masquerading as patriotism are the order of the day. Novorossiya may not have come into being, but the Donbass of the film remains loyal to the motherland, irrespective of how much the motherland may lie. Loznitsa, however, doesn't see the conflict as a legitimate civil war; rather, this is gang warfare, with the concept of civil war used simply to cover-up and legitimatise criminality and the abuse of the working class. Donbass is a place where reality is a commodity, and its only value is in whether or not it can be sold to the masses. If it cannot, then it's worthless. Of course, this situation is not unique to Ukraine - this simulacrum of a functioning society is replicated all over the world, including the United States, where governmental deception and presidential falsehoods haven't reached the level of Donbass, but are certainly moving in that direction. And for people who still value concepts such as truth, honour, and inclusiveness, this is a worrying trend. Because when truth can no longer be used as a weapon, it must be replaced with something far more powerful and far more dangerous - lies.,","black humor,based on a true story,social satire,russian occupation,war in donbass,2010s,political propaganda,",40,32,"Sergey Loznitsa,"

It should not simply be pegged as something only for fantasy nerds, and this film tries to show that. Including interviews with artists from D&D's days when TSR was still around, it gives an interesting explanations of the art and even delves into the creative process.

If I have a complaint, and it's a significant one, it would be the omissions. The film covers art primarily from the first and second editions of the game (it's currently in its fifth edition), which admittedly is the most iconic era of D&D. I would have been interested in seeing an analysis of how the art continued to evolve under Wizards of the Coast in the third and fourth editions (they very, very briefly look at art from the fifth edition).

They also review art specific to popular campaign settings, such as Dragonlance or Dark Sun, but left out one of my personal favorites, Spelljammer. A continuation of this film into the third edition could have included art from Eberron, which was a different type of campaign setting, as well as the controversial Book of Vile Darkness. Maybe they could do this in a sequel. Anyone up for ""Eye of the Beholder II: Behold Harder""?

A great film for fantasy art afficionados as well as a fun trip down memory lane for classic D&D players.,",,0,3,"Brian Stillman,"

- Dolours Price; ""An Open Letter to Gerry Adams"" (July 31, 2005)

_I, Dolours_ is a documentary about Dolours Price, a volunteer (or _óglach_) in the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). More specifically, the film covers her time in the Unknowns, a secret intelligence unit operating out of Belfast in the early 1970s, and her involvement with the first four of the Disappeared; sixteen people abducted, murdered, and secretly buried by the IRA between 1972 and 1985. Revealing hugely controversial information for the first time, covering subject matter which remains deeply emotive and divisive in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and basing all of it on Price's own testimony, the documentary could easily have fallen into the trap of blind partisanship by way of valorising its subject. However, whilst it certainly doesn't condemn her, the dispassion with which it presents her information means that it also never explicitly validates anything she says – this is her account, and it's up to the viewer to accept all, some, or none of it.

Born in Belfast in 1951 into a deeply Republican family, Price's father, Albert, had been a member of the second incarnation of the IRA, and participated in the Coventry portion of S-Plan, a series of bombings carried out throughout the United Kingdom between January 1939 and March 1940. In 1968, Price joined People's Democracy, a political group advocating for civil rights for the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland. However, frustrated with their lack of progress, she became increasingly radicalised, and joined the Provisional IRA in 1971. Initially assigned to low-level tasks (such as cleaning bullets), she was promoted to the Unknowns in 1972, and was later assigned to the team to carry out the Old Bailey bombing in 1973, which left over 200 people injured. Arrested whilst boarding a flight back to Northern Ireland, she, her sister Marian, and eight others were charged. Sentenced to life, her sentence was later commuted to 20 years, and in 1981, having been on hunger strike for over 200 days, on 180 of which she was force-fed, she received the Royal Prerogative of Mercy, and was released on humanitarian grounds. Although she suffered from anorexia, an aversion to food, poor health, and substance abuse for the rest of her life, she married Stephen Rea in 1983, and had two children. A vehement opponent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1999, she believed that Sinn Féin had sold out to the British government, betraying both the Irish people and the memory of dead Republicans. Divorced from Rea in 2003, she died in her sleep in 2013, after mixing sedatives with anti-depressants. However, as _I, Dolours_ conveys extremely well, Price is a far more complex and fascinating character than this deceptively straightforward biographical outline might suggest.

Before examining why this is such a strong piece of work, however, some background is necessary. Strangely enough, the film, which is written by Ed Moloney and Maurice Sweeney, and directed by Sweeney, doesn't do much by way of establishing context (ironically, the trailer has more background info). The film is derived from a taped 2010 interview with Price, conducted by journalists Ed Moloney and (former IRA volunteer) Anthony McIntyre. Moloney had first interviewed Price as a confidential source for his 2001 book, _A Secret History of the IRA_, at which time she confirmed numerous theories regarding the Unknowns and the Disappeared. Subsequently, Moloney became president of the Boston College Oral History Archive, colloquially known as the ""Belfast Project"", an archive of interviews with people involved in the Troubles from both sides of the Republican/Loyalist divide. In December 2009, _The Irish News_, a Nationalist-leaning Belfast newspaper, published a front-page story by Allison Morris, revealing for the first time that Joe Lynskey had been Disappeared by the IRA. A former Cistercian monk who had gone on to become a devout IRA volunteer himself, Lynskey was ""court-martialled"" and sentenced to death for ordering the murder of a fellow volunteer, the husband of a woman with whom he was having an affair. Morris's article was especially notable because Lynskey had not been included on the list of Disappeared which the IRA had released in 1999, and shortly after the story was published, the IRA issued a statement officially acknowledging Lynskey as the first Disappeared.

Exactly what happened next has been disputed ever since. According to Moloney, in February 2010, Price gave an interview to Morris, in which she spoke in detail about her involvement with the Disappeared. Suffering from severe PTSD, and undergoing psychiatric evaluation, Price was on weekend leave from hospital at the time, and gave the interview without the knowledge of her family. When Price's son realised what was happening, he told Morris that his mother was on heavy medication, and thus anything she said would be unreliable. Fearing for her psychological well-being, as well as possible reprisals against her, he asked Morris to stop the interview and hand over the tape. She refused. At this point, he contacted Marian, who made the same request, which Morris again refused. Marian then contacted Noel Doran, _The Irish News_'s editor, who reluctantly agreed to run the interview, but drop the ""_juicy bits_"". However, according to Doran, a completely different series of events took place. He states that Marian initially contacted him to ask him if the paper was planning to run the interview, but he told her that they were still doing their own research into Price's claims, and thus a decision had not yet been made. Several days later, he let Marian know they had decided against running the interview, but would be publishing a statement from Price saying she planned to cooperate with the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR); Doran contends there was never any discussion about the content of an article, because there was never such an article to begin with (The Wild Geese website has an extensive Q&A with Moloney about all of this, including rejoinders from Doran).

Three days after Price's statement regarding the ICLVR was published, Ciaran Barnes of the _Sunday Life_, a Belfast tabloid, published a sensationalist account of Price's involvement with the Disappeared. Barnes has always maintained the source for his article was an interview with Price held in the Boston archive. However, as Barnes could not possibly have gained access to such an interview, Moloney and McIntyre believe Morris turned over her interview to Barnes in the wake of Marian persuading Doran to edit Morris's material. With Price determined to speak to the press about the entire affair, Moloney felt ""_she was going to talk herself into an absolute disaster_"", telling _The Irish Times_,

> _she was threatening to go public with everything. That would have caused enormous damage to herself, to her family, to all sorts of people. I felt I had a duty of care for her. I went to her and said: 'Dolours, you can't do this. But if you want to ensure that your story gets out, then fine, we'll sit down and we'll do it. We'll tape-record it. And then when you are dead – presuming I am still alive – I will fulfil a promise to make sure the film gets made'._

That interview forms the basis for _I, Dolours_.

As an aside, it's worth pointing out that McIntyre was not involved with the making of the film, and refuses to condone it, telling _The Irish News_,

> _I declined to have a role in this documentary, because I don't feel we can on the one hand criticise The Irish News and then on the other hand publish our own [story]. It doesn't add up to me. I would really have to stretch logic to justify this. I can only say from my own perspective. I think the criticism of The Irish News from Ed's perspective certainly becomes invalid._

Moloney, for his part, has written on his blog,

> _the interview with Dolours Price was devised and conducted in an effort to prevent her from taking her story in an indiscriminate way to the media with incalculable consequences for herself and her family. She was seemingly determined to make her story known, but in an uncontrolled way […] The terms of the interview were simple and straightforward. Dolours would give her interview, the original film would be stored away in Ireland and when she died, her story could then be told. I told her that if she predeceased me then I would do my best to tell her story in a truthful and accurate way. If I died first it would be left to others to complete the task. The details of this arrangement were agreed not just between myself and Dolours Price, but were agreed by Anthony McIntyre._

So what exactly is so important about Price's testimony; what does she say that has precipitated a dispute involving two newspapers, five reporters, and an American university, leading to a controversy within Irish journalism that shows little signs of abating (and that's even without mentioning the US Department of Justice's 2011 subpoena of the Boston archive on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), and the resultant legal controversy). In short, what does Price say that prompted Moloney to hold onto the interview until after her death? Well, for one, although she claims the Unknowns was run by Pat McClure, she states that he ""_reported back to the Officer Commanding in Belfast – who would have been Gerry Adams_."" She also alleges that it was Adams who selected the personnel to carry out the Old Bailey bombing. Certainly, this is not the first time he has been accused of this. The claim is also made in Moloney's _Secret History_, and in a 2007 Boston archive interview with Brendan Hughes, former Officer Commanding of the IRA's Belfast Brigade, although the full interview was not made public until 2013. Adams has always denied it, indeed, he denies ever being a member of the IRA at all, and Price's claims in _I, Dolours_ are sure to reopen the debate.

However, the real significance of her interview is the information she provides about four of the Disappeared; Joe Lynskey, Jean McConville, Kevin McKee, and Seamus Wright. According to Price, her task was to transport those marked for death across the border into the Republic of Ireland, where she would hand them over to Dundalk volunteers, after which they would be killed and buried. With the four murders taking place over three missions (McKee and Wright were transported together), Price claims that in two cases, she was simply the driver, but in the third, that of McConville, she was forced to adopt a more hands-on role. And it is here, specifically, where the documentary is at its most controversial, and its strongest. For the most part, Price shows no remorse for her actions, arguing, ""_we believed that informers were the lowest form of human life_,"" emphasising that she disagreed with the tactic of Disappearing, believing instead the bodies should be dumped in the street ""_to put the fear of God_"" into anyone who may have been thinking of informing. The only time she exhibits any signs of real regret is when relating the murder of Joe Lynskey (one of the few people Disappeared for reasons other than informing). Describing him as ""_a gentle, gentle man_,"" Price explains that as she transported him, she wished he would jump out of the car and make a run for it, rather than willingly accepting his faith.

She shows no such feelings, however, in relation to McConville, whose murder remains one of the most controversial and hotly disputed incidents of the Troubles. A widowed mother of ten, McConville's case is so contentious that no one can even agree as to why she was labelled an informer in the first place. When the IRA first acknowledged the Disappeared in 1999, they stated that McConville had had a radio transmitter hidden in her flat, which she used to send information to the British Army, in return for money. However, it was argued at the time that, as a widow trying to raise ten young children, she wouldn't have had access to sensitive information, let alone the time to pass it along. Additionally, in 2006, a report by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland found no corroborating evidence suggesting McConville had been an informer. According to Price, however, the IRA knew she was informing because of an entirely different reason. She claims that McConville was working on identifying suspects from Hastings Street police station in Belfast by way of standing behind a blanket with a small slit for her to look through. However, the blanket didn't come to the ground, and one of those brought in front of her claims he recognised her slippers.

Not only does Price show no regret regarding her role in McConville's death, she seems to recall it with a sense of pride, pointing out she found McConville ""_very arrogant_"", and that during their trip south, McConville, who didn't know the fate awaiting her, said: ""_I knew those Provo bastards wouldn't have the balls to shoot me_."" Numerous people, however, have refuted this, saying McConville would never have spoken in such a manner. Another problem with Price's version of events concerns the revelation regarding her own involvement in the actual murder. As Price tells it, ""_[the Dundalk crew] didn't want to do it. They couldn't bring themselves to execute her. Probably because she was a woman._"" As a result, Price, McClure, and an unidentified third person took McConville to a shallow grave and shot her in the back of the head. She doesn't say which one fired the initial shot, but she does state that the trio deliberately assumed a shared responsibility; their single pistol was passed around, and ""_the other two volunteers each fired a shot so that no one would say that they for certain had been the person to kill her._"" The problem with this is that it is not borne out by the evidence. McConville's remains were discovered in 2003 on a beach on Cooley Peninsula, yet an autopsy found only one bullet wound, and no other bullets in the area. If events played out as Price claims, two of the three shooters missed, and the bullets have never been recovered. Interestingly, however, as the above quote illustrates, as Price describes the murder, she slips into the third-person, recounting the incident as though it was someone else involved, even though it is clear she is speaking of herself.

Whilst the film is definitely at its best when dealing with the McConville murder, its handling of other aspects of Price's story are also laudable. For example, it does a fine job of tracing her ideological development, particularly as it relates to her family. Speaking of her father's role in S-Plan, Price proudly describes how he went to the UK ""_to fight the imperial master_"", and also recalls how he later told her, ""_I blew them up before you did. The only difference is I didn't get caught_"". Additionally, the film spends time dealing with Price's aunt, Bridie, an IRA volunteer who lost her hands and eyes in an accident handling grenades when she was 25. Although Price hated the job, she would sit with Bridie, holding her cigarette, obviously proud of the older woman's commitment, and feeling compelled ""_to validate her sacrifice._""

In this sense, the film is very much about the seductive power of some of the more romantic myths of Irish Republicanism (they're not terrorists killing innocent people, they're volunteers fighting colonial oppressors, sacrificing everything for the good of the Irish nation) contrasted with the savage day-to-day reality of waging a guerrilla war (there is some horrific footage of bomb victims). The film makes it extremely easy to see the attraction of the sectarian moral code under which Price operated, and into which she was indoctrinated as a child; the absolute and unrelenting desire to unite Ireland by any means necessary, the goal of such historical titans as Theobald Wolfe Tone (1763-1798), Bartholomew Teeling (1774-1798), Robert Emmet (1778-1803), William Tennant (1759-1832), James Stephens (1825-1901), Tom Clarke (1858-1916), and Pádraig Pearse (1879-1916). It's good company for a directionless young Catholic in a majority Protestant state, and the attractiveness of such ideological rigidity is cogently presented. The film clearly and concisely charts Price's radicalisation as she transitions from civil rights activist to convicted bomber to hunger striker to peace process critic, detailing, for example, her participation in the 1969 People's Democracy march that ended at Burntollet Bridge with Loyalists attacking the peaceful protestors, as the Royal Ulster Constabulary refused to intervene. Like many of her generation, Price sees this as a decisive turning point in Ulster Republicanism, realising of the Loyalists and Unionists, ""_I'm never going to convince these people._""

Interspersed with the interview material and archive footage, there are a number of reconstructions, with Price played by Lorna Larkin. According to director Maurice Sweeny,

> _there was an element of necessity there because first there wasn't a huge amount of archive of Dolours herself, or her family. She'd been in prison for eight years of the key times we're talking about. We had that one voice, we didn't have other interviews, because we'd made that editorial decision. I suppose the word 're-enactment' is often used, but I kind of see it as more of a visual memory of hers in the film. We have three: we have an archive of the North, bombs, riots, which is quite frenetic visually on screen. Then we had a standalone sit-down interview. And I just wanted something to go from her narrative, in and out of her childhood, her time in prison. It's always very hard to get those right. We were very careful about how we shot it. We cut the film, almost, before we shot it, because we had that bed of an interview. It was almost her looking back at those iconic moments in her life._

Aesthetically, these reconstructions are quite interesting, insofar as they often feature Larkin, in character, speaking directly to camera – an unusual stylistic device in a documentary already featuring a lot of interview footage, but one which works because it fortifies the central organisational principal; this is _her_ account of events. By employing such a subjective approach in the film's only ostensibly objective sections, this impression is enhanced even further.

Towards the end of _I, Dolours_, Price refers to the Good Friday agreement as ""_a failure of my life's purpose,_"" arguing ""_I wouldn't have missed a good breakfast for what Sinn Féin achieved,_"" and subsequently, one of the last things she says is, ""_It's all been for nothing._"" This can come across as either the deeply tragic end to a life lived for her country, or the just deserts for a murderer, depending on your politics. And the fact that her story is so emotive, irrespective of which side of the debate upon which you fall, speaks very much to the quality of the work in which that story is presented. Powerful, contentious documentary filmmaking of the highest calibre, _I, Dolours_ should be made required viewing in Irish schools, north and south of the border.,",,12,1,"Maurice Sweeney,"

It's a story of cassette tapes, corner shops and glitter-clad musical heroes, of teenagers bunking off school to attend secret daytime gigs and of generational culture clashes - as this underground scene became as popular among Asians as Wham and Culture Club were to the mainstream.  The film traces the birth of bhangra amid the early Punjabi immigrants in the steel foundries of the West Midlands.
