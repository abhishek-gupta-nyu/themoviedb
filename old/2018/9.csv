I mean... It's not great. There were a few moments I found myself thinking ""This bit's pretty bad, why did they do this?"" and a lot of moments I found myself thinking ""This bit's pretty good, but they still probably should have just made a **real** _Venom_ movie with Marvel.""

But it's fine. The absolute best parts are the interactions taking place within Venom himself (between Brock and the Symbiote) and the movie would have been a lot worse if Tom Hardy wasn't capable of pulling that off. Look, a _Venom_ movie probably should have been rated R, and it probably should have taken more notes from current superhero movies than superhero movies from fifteen years ago, but I still had a good time with _Venom_, maybe it's not the best possible version of the story, but I'm still glad we have this one.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._,Venom is a great comic adaptation. I really like what they did with the character and the story. I thought the film was done well. The special effects are pretty good. I thought the characters were cast well, and overall I just enjoyed it. The film is pretty dark and violent despite the PG-13 rating. It didn't have a lot of blood, but there was a bit here and there. Characters are mostly tossed around and beaten, but a lot of them are not shown dead. That being said, some characters are still killed on screen. People are experimented on. A few people are slashed and stabbed. Guns are used, but not frequently. It definitely pushed the PG-13 as far as it could. There is a lot of language throughout, including an f-bomb. There is also a lot of drinking. I definitely recommend this movie. I think it is better suited for teens and up, but older kids that can handle strong violence may be okay.,I very much like it if you ask me (;,Venom - **SPOILERS**

4/10

There seems to be quite a bit of agreement on what Im about to say about the film. Venom doesnt quite know what it is. It cant decide wether its a goofy, action or a horror movie. Therefore its all of it and none at the same time. 

The goofy jokes are pretty lame, which is why they are funny, you dont laugh with the writers, you laugh at them. 

The action scenes are meh at best, 
car chase : check
motorcycle : check
ridiculous (bad) cgi fight: check
sure, watching Tom Hardy motorcross in San Francisco is quite fun, but its not really action. 

Finally, the horror; there are glimpses, glimmers of hope scattered around this movie. Little snippets of what could have been, but as soon as they appear they disappear. 

Two scenes really stood out to me due to their potential. After quite a lot of buildup of Venom getting into the building (BY RUNNING UP IT), Eddie decides to take the lift down. Instead of having Eddie walk into the SWAT team, they should have been swarming the building crawling through the floors looking for him. Then, they could have had an ALIEN like hunting scene where Venom slowly takes out the task force one by one, in true horror movie fashion. 

The other obvious horror scene could have been using the creepy little girl that delivers RIOT to the Musk wannabe, they could have homaged The Shining, they could have pulled an exorcist, they could have done a million things, but the little girl just has white pupils and a deep voice.

Throughout the movie there are just continuous disappointments because you see what it is missing. 

Instead of the cheap love story and all the stupid overdone things they should have been ballsy with their movie. Yes the movie DID make 800+ million, however im sure it was going to do that anyway. Venom is probably one of the most badass characters in comic history, and Tom Hardy is Tom Hardy. 

I would have loved to see something along these lines:

Symbiote hunts Eddie. 
Symbiote captures Eddie and they become Venom.
Venom starts unleashing hell because he can, hunts SWAT etc. 
Venom goes after Musk wannabe and Kills him.

Throw some more horror elements in there, and it would have made for a much more satisfactory watch. I have always adored Venom, and this movie had so much potential, but it was all for nothing. No rewatchability. Nothing worth remembering. Just a flick.

It was funny seeing Tom Hardy being a bit of a pussball, but even he cant help a crap script and an even worse film.,It’s school holidays here in France which means the kids are at my place which in turn means lot’s of time in front of the screen. Last night it was Venom’s turn to be plopped into my Blu-ray player.

I have to say that I was a little disappointed. Sure it is a good movie and I did indeed enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. According to the ratings it looked like the majority of the audience liked it a lot and I do like the character Venom. Sure the culture elite and politically correct idiots that Rotten Tomates use as “critics” claimed it to be rotten but, for me, that’s usually a good sign when it comes to my entertainment value from a movie.

The good things are that I found Venom, the creature, really cool. I liked his voice, his appearance and his no-nonsense attitude. The special effects and the action was very enjoyable to watch. Luckily that was my main reason for watching the movie. Actually, it is probably the main reason I want to watch any Marvel movie, especially lately given the poor quality of writers that Marvel has employed.

I guess it is a plus as well that there was not too much politically correct, green or social preaching in it. I am sure those so inclined can find more than me if they go looking for it but most of the movie audience, at least not for this type of movie, probably could not care less.

The main reason I felt somewhat disappointed is that the main protagonist is really not someone I could feel like I would root for. He is such a despicable douche-bag. For starters he is a low life journalist with an overblown ego and disrespect of pretty much everything. The kind CNN would employ. Even when he’s been infected by Venom he continues between being a worthless egoistic coward and just an asshole. Actually the only real difference between the him and the big bad guy is that the bad guy is a hundred times more intelligent. It’s not until the very end scenes that Eddie develops a minimum of likability.

On the other hand Venom is really the star of the movie. Both as a “thing” and as a character. He is a real bad-ass, quite funny and really everything that Eddie should have been as a character. He even develops more as a character than previously mentioned douche-bag.

It’s a shame since otherwise this would have been a great movie. The story is simple but works well for this kind of movie. There are no silly twists and convoluted sub-plots. The main protagonist, as poor as he is, at least do not carry a lot of past history trying to explain God knows what and such stuff.

If the character of the main protagonist would have been more likable this would have been a great movie. Now it is “just” good.,I thought it was pretty cool. Venom was a pretty good villain marvel film.,","san francisco, california,spacecraft,anti hero,alien life-form,superhero,based on comic,spin off,aftercreditsstinger,duringcreditsstinger,business tycoon,genetic experiment,spiderverse,sony's marvel universe,",58,61,"Ruben Fleischer,"

The film smacks of studio interference and bad decisions.  It starts off decent enough but at the halfway point it turns into a shambles and it does feel as if a lot of it ended up on the cutting room floor.  The music was very intrusive and some scenes were so badly lit you had no idea who was just killed or even what killed them.

Some knowing nods to the earlier Predator films was a nice touch and it was good they didn't skimp on the gore and violence but all in all it's a bad movie.  Stick to Predator and Predators.,My mind was racing as I watched _The Predator_ in the cinema tonight. I'd heard virtually nothing good about it so my anxious brain kicked into overdrive the whole time the film was going on. As a result of that, I almost feel like I experienced three movies in that theatre. First, obviously the movie on the screen. Secondly, the awesome movie I was theorising could unfurl at the result of each new sequence and plot point, but that sadly never did. And thirdly, the inexcusably awful and franchise-ruining movie that I feared it was about to take a hard left turn into at any minute, and thankfully never did.

And that's really my experience on _The Predator_ overall, and the reason for a stalemate ""2.5 outta 5"" review: It wasn't as good as it should have been, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Unfortunately, when the movie I'm writing in my head alongside watching it is better than what's actually on screen, when you take into account that I'm an unimaginative, talentless hack, really doesn't cut it for a sequel to _Predator_, one of of only five movies I've ever given a perfect rating to.

The best parts of _The Predator_ are when there is an eponymous Predator on screen. So you might think, ""Oh it's not a good movie, but it's a good _Predator_ movie"", and fair enough a conclusion to draw, but no. Part of the problem is, this movie really could have been pulled off with any aliens at all. Take out the Yautja and replace them with... I dunno, the blue skinned pogo-stick people of Planet Hurfadump, and it can still play out functionally the same. See, although I enjoyed watching the Predators do their thing, there was really nothing beyond cosmetic similarities that made them the Predators we've seen in every movie preceding this one.

I think possibly part of the reason for that is that every other movie with a Predator in it has been an Action Horror movie (albeit Action Horror with ever-increasing Sci-Fi elements from film to film) whereas _The Predator_ is an Action Comedy, just one with some gore. Now I don't think that taking it that route was necessarily and... abysmal failure, let's say, but was Action Comedy the **best** way to take the _Predator_ franchise? I think it's pretty clear that the answer is no.

Ironic that that direction is being taken by Shane Black, the man who has a history with _Predator_ purely because the crew of the first film were determined to have him to work on the script, which he refused. Now here we are more 30 years later and Shane Black finally **has** put his name on a Predator movie, and it's not even good.

Fuck. At least it's better than _AvP: Requiem_!,I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was inclined to step out of the theater to check if I was sitting in the right room. But there it was, definitely a Predator, but obviously totally misplaced in a ridiculous movie - ridiculous story, ridiculous characters, ridiculous acting, ridiculous everything.

I was so upset. One of the diamonds of a movie genre thrown in the dirt and made fun of. If you want to see how that's done, watch this one.

A total waste of money - on production side and on cinema visitor's side.,Its just not good.  The first predator created atmosphere; you were being hunted.  The only ""Predator"" film to deliver another dose of this was Predators.  
This film falls completely short of its predecessors (yes, all of them), but does leave you with a strong impression that this was a cash grab to squeeze any life out of a franchise that surpassed its EOL a long time ago.,OK, I have to disagree with the other reviewers, to date, of this movie.  I totally enjoyed this movie and gave it an 8.  Once you figured it out, I thought the story line made complete sense.  I loved all the new characters, and thought the camaraderie of the main military characters was great and rather realistic.  I don't know about the other reviewers, but I did serve in the U. S. Army and found the character interplay highly realistic.  I am disappointed with the interplay between the ""good guys"" and our government; however, these days you come to expect that.  I don't believe that part would be realistic, but I don't think it distracted that much from the movie, and everyone came together in the end...to, of course, save humanity!  Which, of course, it did otherwise we all wouldn't be here anymore...right?  Good movie!  Go see it and then decide for yourself, but I thought it was definitely worth seeing, so much so I even bought the blu-ray!,A crushing disappointment.

The hopes were high for this latest Predator rebirth, not because Shane Black starred in the great first Predator film, so therefore he surely must care about the project? But because he's an excellent writer and director. Shane Black can count Lethal Weapon(S), The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight on his CV, he was the man who put Iron Man back on track after the sag of part 2. Plus he is the creator of two of the best buddy buddy neo-noirs this millennium (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang/The Nice Guys), So how come The Predator stinks of lazy cash cow manure?

Plot in a nutshell sees the universe's most lethal hunters unleashed on Earth due to the meddling of a soldiers kid and some nosey scientist types. The fate of mankind rests with a group of damaged ex-soldiers and a rather cheesed off female scientist.

We have a rehash mishmash of what we have seen before in Predator 87 and Predators 2010. A group dynamic fighting a seemingly invincible foe. The subsequent science aspects such as human DNA inference/reasoning etc never really add up to much, serving only for a bunch of standard actors shouting, swearing and spouting hopelessly weak jokes and series re-treads. When you think the pic is about to up a gear, get rivetingly dramatic, a poor slice of humour comes our way either by vocal spillage or visual drivel (puppy pet Predator dog, really?). There's a bunch of plot threads that just dangle never to be pulled (PTSD/our hero's family strife et al), and the Predators loose on Earth - with different agendas - are confusingly shifted about by a screenplay not sure where it wants to land. 

Plus points? Well the cinematography is superb (Larry Fong), and you can't fault this for action quotas, there's plenty of it and it's bloody (both red and green type). The score is the traditional one we had from Alan Silvestri back in the 87 film, in fact it hardly deviates from it and yet Henry Jackman gets the credit. Of course some of the jokes will work for some folk (I would be lying if I said a Whoopi Goldberg gag didn't make me laugh), but the terror has gone, these Predators are no longer scary creatures. This reeks of a troubled production going hand in hand with a cash cow that not only narratively adds up to nothing really, but of a franchise death knell.

Slow and boring. Not even the Conjuring hype could save this film. It moves forward at a painful pace, brings nothing new to the table, and is not even scary.,Overall I liked The Nun it was a spooky fun movie with some pretty good shots and scenes (lighting, camera angles, and such). The transitions from one scene to another was a bit off and the story overall had a more fantasy tone over the more grounded and realistic tone The Conjuring and Annabelle movies had. Much of the story felt like it was just forced to setup a shot or scene which does hurt it. It isn't a perfect movie but I'd watch it again. It is like Indiana Jones meets Silent Hill. None of the character actors felt out of place or superficial either, I really appreciate that. Everyone felt believable and natural to their roles and environment, not forced.,Horror is baaaaack! 
And with a vengeance.

The Nun is not for people that don’t like horror movies or burnt out on them. Don't expect character development either. Don't expect to be shock like you were when you watched The Exorcist. I’ve read several critic reviews were they just don’t get it. They use words to describe it like “using every trick in the horror trope” or “predictable”, “throwing the kitchen sink at”, or “not enough character development”. Well forget what you heard because there is more bite to this movie than you’d expect. 

Okay, so we begin with a spooky opening sequence where two nuns are fighting to save humanity from a malevolent presence that is about to enter our world. One is dragged into a room and the other commits suicide by hanging. Suicide is a sin, right? Makes you wonder what type of evil is powerful enough to destroy Catholic nuns?

Being the beginning of The Conjuring movie universe, this story begins like this, Father Burke (Demién Bichir) is summoned by the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a nun at The Abbey, a castle located somewhere in Romania. Apparently Father Burke has a trauma and a shameful past after having failed to save a teen from an exorcism he performed. Makes you wonder why The Vatican would send a priest like Father Burke on such a dangerous mission. The Vatican doesn’t send Father Burke alone on this task though. They assign Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who hasn’t yet taken her vows. A nun that hasn't taken her vows yet, and not your typical nun either. She's contrary to the average nun. She seems so innocent.

Father Burke and Sister Irene are taken to The Abbey by a local delivery man, Frechie (Jonas Bloquet). (You may remember Frenchie as the first exorcism performed by The Warrens from the original The Conjuring. Lorraine Warren has the painting of The Nun at their home and references it in the film.) Sister Irene was chosen to go on this assignment because she experiences visions, these visions provide the information needed to uncover what actually occurred at The Abbey.

The Abbey has been the site of a malevolent force locked away for centuries. The Church took over The Abbey and placed a congregation of nuns to pray 12 hours a day to keep the evil force in control. However, after WW2 bombing weaken the structure of The Abbey, the evil locked inside of it found another way to escape, and using the guise of a nun, slowly grows in strength causing terror on those around it. 

Yes, The Nun is a supernatural survival horror installment of The Conjuring universe. You don’t have to be a die hard fan of the horror genre in order to be scared. Yes, there is a lot of the same tropes from the most popular supernatural horror movies and that is because this is how demonic infestation happens. 
Director Corin Hardy and screenplay writer Gary Dauberman do wonderfully.

What this film gives us is tricky camera and visual effects that showcase how the demon works. We find out that the demon’s name is Valak–an ancient demon from Hell that was summoned by the count performed sacrificial rituals. 
If you are expecting character development then you’re not going to find it here. This story doesn’t need a lot of characters at all. You don’t need a lot of information about these characters because Valak is the only character this story is about.. One minute he’s behind the character’s back, the next his shadow appears on the wall, he reanimates dead corpses and even manifesting animals and the usual superhuman strength as well as taking on human form. He ghosts the characters as well. It’s always interesting to see how the director and screenwriter pull off these visual effects. 

Father Burke character plays like a detective searching the castle for any information he can use to exorcise the demonic spirit from the world while Sister Irene uses her visions to lead her to the truth about what occurred at The Abbey as well as discover anything that she can use to send the evil spirit back to Hell. If you like Ash from the Evil Dead horror series, then you’ll like Frenchie because he is the outsider in all of this providing necessary dark humor. Frenchie isn’t afraid to use a shotgun to blow off the heads of a couple of deadites disguised as nuns.

What also makes this film enjoyable to watch with a group, is the pacing. There are enough slow moments for you to make jokes about the characters or the visual bombarding your senses.

I give this film an enthusiastic 7/10 for its creepy mood and intense disturbing images. And those squeamish people, no worries. There isn't a lot of gore. 

Definitely a great popcorn horror flick to watch in the dark with your friends. Definitely worth the movie ticket. You won't be disappointed as long as you keep what I've said in this review in mind.
If I were to rate its place among the other films in The Conjuring universe, I would rate as follows

1) The Conjuring
2) The Conjuring 2
3) The Nun

* 4) Annabelle Creation,I wanted to like this movie because it's connected to Conjuring movies, but it was awful, even from the start it was obvious.

It was a dull, boring movie with cheap jump scares. The only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 3, because it was shot nicely and acting wasn't that bad.,The Nunjuring!

When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate...

So here we have the latest spin-off from the one time high quality ""Conjuring"" franchise. Sticking strictly to a formula that will either infuriate or satiate horror genre fans, ""The Nun"" delivers enough creepy boo-jump tropes to keep it above average. There's plenty of roaming about dark corridors and churchyards, with lanterns our only prominent saviours from the terrors of the dark. If, and it's a big if, you don't mind that Corin Hardy's film isn't trying to raise the bar for horror, and is in fact staying safe, then there's a decent enough good time to be had here. If you be one of those who constantly moans about bringing nothing new to the table, don't bother with this one, in fact, think of something new to bring to the table yourselves then... 

The set-pieces hold up well enough (buried alive shiver shiver), the atmospheric dread only occasionally punctured by Abel Korzeniowski's bombastic score. The story is interesting enough, such as why the entity is bringing terror to the abbey, what is the link to the ""Warren"" family, and the backstory axis for Father Burke (Demián Bichir) brings another demonic layer to the plotting. While talking about ""bringing something new to the table"", for the first time in this series we actually get a bit of humour, mostly from Jonas Bloquet's likable Frenchie character. Taissa Farmiga holds the lead well, where she has a very appealing visual reaction style that will serve her well if she stays in genre mode. While Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (low lights and fogs) is a big improvement from ""Annabelle: Creation"" and is tonally compliant.

This formula has been done much better previously, such as Hammer's take on ""The Woman In Black"", but even then they were going on about new stuff being brought to the table etc etc etc. It is what it is, a boo-jump haunted house (buildings) picture that is there for those who like such things, who buy into it on that level. Is this a great film? Absolutely not, but it works on its intended terms and any expectation of a new branch of horror is going to have you crying over spilt blood. 6/10,Not the literal **worst** entry in the series (that laurel still rests firmly upon the crown of _Annabelle_) and there was a couple of cool design moments, like creepy hands busting out of statues, even the acting is of acceptable level. But that's about everything positive I can say for _The Nun_, 'cause this is pretty dang bad.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._,I was surprise about how much I enjoy this film. Jack Black and Cate Blanchett are great together in this film. The film felt like a 80s kids horror film. I would love to see more films with these characters.

Every year, there are a couple of underrated and/or overlooked movies. Greta is 2019’s first film to belong to both categories. It was definitely overlooked since Hellboy stole the spotlight, and it’s also underrated based on online feedback. Critics being divisive is kind of expected, but audiences are disliking Greta more than the former group, which I find quite surprising. Nevertheless, I enjoyed a lot and that’s mostly due to the outstanding performances of its leads. Isabelle Huppert is incredible as Greta, as expected from such an acclaimed actress. Her character has a very mysterious personality which is well-developed throughout the runtime. Undeniably, her character’s past and decisions turn out to be a bit questionable, in terms of logic. I don’t believe that it’s straight-up rubbish, but I can’t deny that some aspects of her persona lack consistency and sense. Fortunately, it’s nowhere near Serenity‘s level of absurdity. In the end, Huppert elevates her script and delivers a creepily captivating display. 

Chloë Grace Moretz is one of the most talented young actresses out there, and I already stated a few years ago that she will be a much-desired star, sooner or later. In this movie, she shows off the subtlety of her expressions at the same time that she proves how amazing her range is. She embodies the charitable and innocent personality of her character like she is, indeed, Frances. Two wonderful performances that become even better due to the palpable chemistry that the two actresses have with each other. With such a short runtime, their interactions are interesting in the beginning, becoming more and more intriguing as time goes by. In addition to these two, Maika Monroe (Erica Penn) surprised the hell out of me! Not only her character doesn’t follow the stereotypical “blonde, dumb friend”, but she really offers an exceptional performance.

The screenplay does have some narrative issues, being most of them related to Greta, as mentioned above. It’s hard to imagine that what happens in the second half of the film could occur in real life as it’s depicted, which instantly kills most movies. However, it’s not as unbelievable as people might think at first, and after some thought, it’s actually pretty reasonable, having in mind the psychological factor. It doesn’t separate itself from the genre’s cliches and it’s quite predictable throughout, even though the ending comes as a nice surprise. It’s the typical B-movie that’s good to see at home on a Sunday afternoon, but if you catch it in the theaters, you won’t regret the money spent.

Greta is 2019’s first underrated and overlooked film. With two extremely captivating performances by Isabelle Huppert and Chloë Grace Moretz, this B-movie truly stands out from the most recent flicks of the same type. The leads’ chemistry carries most of the engaging story, even though a word of praise must go to Maika Monroe for her display. The indisputable narrative problems can either be completely nonsensical or reasonable, at best, depending on what kind of moviegoer you are. There are enough justifications for interpreting the second half events and Huppert‘s character actions as both silly or realistic. I stand on the latter, and I enjoyed myself during the whole runtime. Go see it if you catch it near you. If you don’t, be sure to watch at home.

Rating: B,**_Insubstantial and forgettable, but Huppert makes it moderately entertaining_**

> _The philosopher is right who says that nothing thicker than a knife's blade separates happiness from melancholy; and he goes on to opine that one is twin fellow to the other; and draws from this the conclusion that all extremes of feeling are allied with madness._

- Virginia Woolf; _Orlando_ (1928)

In Claude Chabrol's _Violette Nozière_ (1978), Isabelle Huppert plays a prostitute who contracts syphilis from a client, tells her parents she inherited the disease from them, kills her father, tries to kill her mother, and falsely claims that her father molested her. In Chabrol's _La Cérémonie_ (1995), she plays a woman who shoots an entire family to death as they watch TV. In Michael Haneke's _La Pianiste_ (2001), she plays a pianist who uses broken glass to injure the hand of a fellow professional. In Christophe Honoré's _Ma Mère_ (2004), she plays a woman who commits suicide whilst having sex with her son, timing it so that her death coincides with his orgasm (just don't ask). In Paul Verhoeven's _Elle_ (2016), she plays a rape victim who sets out for revenge on her rapist, all the while indulging in ever more extreme play-rape scenarios with her (married) neighbour. It's quite a CV of depravity (and that's only five of the 120+ films in which she has appeared).

And so we have _Greta_. Written by Ray Wright (_Pulse_; _Case 39_) and Neil Jordan, and directed by Jordan (_The Company of Wolves_; _The Crying Game_; _Interview with the Vampire_; _Michael Collins_), this is schlocky B-movie territory through-and-through, with a completely ridiculous plot and over-the-top final act, all infused with a ludicrous generic campiness. It's one of those films that's so utterly horrendous in almost every way, it's actually kind of enjoyable. Kind of. Very much in the tradition of stalker-thrillers such as Brian De Palma's _Body Double_ (1984), Adrian Lyne's _Fatal Attraction_ (1987), and Barbet Schroeder's _Single White Female_ (1992), although nowhere near as good as any of them, _Greta_ was introduced at the Venice Film Festival as ""_a twisted little thriller_"". Well, it's certainly twisted, and it's also rather little, but there isn't a huge amount of thrilling going on. Same problem if you want to call it a psychological thriller, as there's precious little psychology. In fact, there's precious little of anything going on, as Jordan seems to have precisely nothing to say; the film simply isn't inherently _about_ anything. Although it is good for a few laughs (and I'm pretty sure not all of them intentional).

Frances McCullen (Chloë Grace Moretz), a young Bostonian, is sharing an apartment in New York with her college friend Erica Penn (Maika Monroe). Having recently lost her mother to cancer, she is all-but-estranged from her workaholic father Chris (the great Canadian Shakespearean actor Colm Feore), with every conversation painfully taut. Returning home from her waitress job, Frances finds a handbag on the subway belonging to Greta Hideg (Huppert). Bringing the bag to Greta's house, the two share tea, as Greta explains her husband died some time ago, and her daughter is living in Paris, leaving her feeling lonely. They strike up a friendship, with each filling an emotional void in the other's life. Although Erica thinks the relationship is ""weird"", Frances ignores her, and she and Greta grow ever closer. However, as Greta prepares dinner one evening, Frances finds a collection of handbags identical to the one she found on the subway, each labelled with a name and phone number. Deeply concerned, Frances tries to cut ties with Greta, conceding that Erica was correct. Greta, however, has no intentions of allowing Frances to walk out of her life.

_Greta_ is Neil Jordan's eighteenth film, and the eleventh to feature Stephen Rea (here playing a rather useless private detective), and his output has always been patchy; for every classic like _Mona Lisa_ (1986) and _The Crying Game_, there's a _We're No Angels_ (1989) and a _Byzantium_ (2012). Something in which he has always been interested, and which infuses many of his films, is folklore, especially fairy tales. Obvious in films such as _The Company of Wolves_ (1984), _High Spirits_ (1988), _In Dreams_ (1999), and _Ondine_ (2009), it's also to be found just below the surface in everything from _Angel_ (1985) to _The Miracle_ (1991) to _Breakfast on Pluto_ (2005). In _Greta_, Jordan allows his familiarity with the tropes of classic fairy tales to imbue the film's _milieu_, especially in relation to Greta's home, which is so obviously inspired by ""Hansel and Gretel"" it may as well as have been made of gingerbread, whilst Frances has more than a hint of Little Red Riding Hood's innocence and _naïveté_ about her.

However, this is a Roger Corman-style B-movie before it is anything else. For example, something you see a lot in B-movie thrillers is that when danger is apparent, otherwise intelligent characters must act like complete and utter simpletons; so, upon a barrage of calls and texts from Greta, Frances neither blocks Greta's number nor changes her own; when Greta starts calling the landline, neither Frances nor Erica think to unplug it; although it's never explicitly stated that Greta has a key to the girls' apartment, the fact that she seems to pop in and out at will suggests she does, yet the girls don't change the locks; Frances's big plan to combat Greta is to root through her garbage to try to find something incriminating; when trapped in Greta's house, after trying the door and one window, Frances thinks the best course of action is to flee to the dark cellar. Whether the film intends for this level of stupidity to be humorous or not is beside the point; anyone who has ever seen a movie (any movie) will surely get a chuckle from such appalling writing

The question one must ask, then, is whether or not Jordan is actually in on the joke. It remains somewhat ambiguous, but I would say, for the most part, that he is not, and that he seems to take the material relatively seriously. What is certain, however, is that Huppert is very much aware of the ludicrousness around her. Although _Greta_ is nowhere near the most extreme character she's played, she is clearly having an absolute blast with the part - whether it's delivering her lines as if she's over-rehearsed them, literally dancing across the set as she commits homicide, spitting chewing-gum into Frances's hair, gleefully engaging in some DIY emergency medicine, standing completely motionless in a city street, or overturning a table as if her life depended on it, you rarely see a performance wherein the performer is so joyful; she practically winks at the camera a couple of times. She commits totally to every bonkers moment, which come thick and fast in the last act. Without her exuberant performance, the film would be virtually unwatchable; Moretz is fairly wooden; Monroe's Erica is a blank slate rather than a character; Feore is wasted in only two scenes; and Rea is his usual hang-dog self. Only Huppert pops. But man alive does she pop bigly!

Thematically, the film flirts with a few issues, but never really penetrates any of them. One could certainly read it as a satire of NYPD inefficiency, the ineffectiveness of the justice system, and the misnomer that in a post #MeToo society, it's easier for women to report instances of stalking and harassment and be believed; when Frances makes a formal complaint about Greta, a bored policeman tells her ""_it's not harassment if it's in a public place_"". Later on, when Frances tries to file a restraining order, she is told it could be months before her case is heard. When Greta is taken into custody at one point, she is released almost immediately, despite clearly being unstable.

From an aesthetic point of view, the film signals its campiness right from the off, opening with Julie London's 1963 cover of ""Where Are You?"" As you would expect from Jordan, the film looks great. In relation to the production design by Anna Rackard (_Boy Eats Girl_; _Love & Friendship_), the dark brown classical feel of the interior of Greta's house, with delicate sunlight filtering through the curtains, and looking, for all the world, like a 19th century rural French cottage, contrasts sharply with the bright, grey, modernist look of the girls' sleek apartment. Jordan's regular set decorator John Neligan must also be mentioned, as he fills Greta's house with innumerable trinkets whilst leaving the girls' environment relatively unadorned. Also worth mentioning is how Jordan and director of photography Seamus McGarvey (_The Hours_; _We Need to Talk About Kevin_; _Nocturnal Animals_) shoot scenes of Greta watching Frances menacingly from outside the restaurant where she works - placing her dead centre in the frame as she remains completely motionless, in the midst of a flurry of movement and passers-by all around her. It's a very creepy image. 

Another really well mounted part of the film is a scene where Greta is following Erica. Although neither Erica nor the audience ever actually see Greta, we know she's there, because she keeps sending Frances picture messages of her pursuit, as Frances is on the phone to Erica telling her to run. The editing by Nick Emerson (_Starred Up_; _Lady Macbeth_; _Daphne_) is especially impressive here, cutting rhythmically between Erica, Frances, and inserts of the picture messages, as the tension mounts. Again, it's a very unsettling scene, and a unique way to stage a chase. Finally, there's the sound design by Stefan Henrix (_The Devil's Double_; _Britannia_), which is noticeable in what it doesn't do; whenever we are outside, there are the typical sounds of a city that you would expect, however, when we move into Greta's house, the sound design is dialled back almost to zero (much quieter than the girls' apartment), creating the impression of the house as somehow separate from the frantic pace of the city right outside the door.

On the other hand, the aesthetic very much lets the film down in terms of location. Although set in New York, it was shot primarily in Dublin, with some pick-ups in Toronto, and it shows. Granted, I live in Dublin and was able to pick out most of the locations in a way someone not from here wouldn't. But irrespective of that, the filmmakers seem to have made little effort to disguise the location; from the sequence of the traffic lights to the side of the road on which the cars drive to the street signs. It's very distracting, and really wouldn't have required that much effort to fix. This is especially irritating insofar as the location's significance is built into the script (it's mentioned several times that if Frances were from New York she would never have picked up the bag). So the fact that so little effort has gone into actually making the film look like it was shot in New York is disappointing.

Unfortunately, there are a myriad of other problems. For starters, there's the script, which never feels like anything other than pure genre fare. Yes, it's to be lauded for using women in the role of both stalker and stalked, when stalker-thrillers have traditionally been about male anxiety. However, it doesn't take this trope anywhere, as if simply having two women at the centre is enough, and doesn't need further comment. When _clichéd_ issues like vulnerability, loneliness, and obsession are presented in a _clichéd_ manner, they don't cease to be _clichéd_ just because they've been given an undercoat of pseudo-feminism. The opportunity to engage with gender politics is right there, but is disappointingly avoided. 

Another problem with the script is that none of the characters are given much in the way of interiority or psychological verisimilitude. Frances and Greta have some rudimentary backstory, but it isn't enough to compensate for their lack of psychology. There's little emotional complexity anywhere in the film, no real sense of any of the characters having an unconscious. And whilst the ludicrousness of Huppert's performance distracts from this and transcends the limitations of the writing, Moretz remains unable to break free. In this sense, she comes across like a cog in the screenwriters' machinery, only behaving in such and such a way because the plot dictates it, with scene after perfunctory scene doing only enough to get us to the next scene and nothing else. Neither Moretz nor Monroe are able to escape the generic moulds of their character-types; the bright-eyed and innocent newbie whose kindness will be her downfall, and the tough friend who seems churlish and cynical but who ultimately proves to have been right all along.

_Greta_ is a rote stalker-thriller that looks great, but offers nothing we haven't seen before; it's essentially a potboiler in a nice suit. No different from any of the late 80s/early 90s obsession thrillers, the plot is plodding and uninspired and the characters are underwritten. When all is said and done, it's hard to really figure out what Jordan was aiming for with this. You can't call it a psychological thriller about obsession and loneliness, because it does nothing with these themes, but you can't call it a self-aware and campy B-movie, because Jordan doesn't seem to be fully cognisant that it's campy schlock. Huppert's batshit insane performance elevates the material significantly, but even she can't paper over all the cracks. It's been 23 years since Jordan has made anything of real significance, and on the evidence of his last few films, it's going to be a while before he does so again.,Decent enough thriller but not especially memorable, though both Isabelle Huppert and Chloe Grace Moretz turned in fine performances. It's probably fine as a rental.,","paris, france,new york city,finger,psychopath,stalker,basement,dog,evil,roofie,older woman younger woman relationship,",22,16,"Neil Jordan,"

Without going into spoilers, I was probably in the wrong mindset to enjoy it properly. 

But, it stuck with me for days later and I couldn't stop thinking about it. I ended up liking it a lot and will re-watch it as soon as I get the chance. 

It's visually stunning and the soundtrack complements the visuals perfectly. Soundtrack is getting released in September and I will definitely get it.

Not an easy movie to digest, even though there are some scenes that will definitely leave you wondering if they were meant as comedy or if they were just done wrong. 

This mostly comes down to Cage's somewhat uneven performance - but it's nothing like Wicker Man and it only comes down to a couple of individual shots.

Highly recommended!,Definitely not for everyone, this is a niche-of-a-niche type of film: psychedelic-art-horror with a dash of comedy. And I loved it. Some incredible shots and scenes with tons of mind bending crap. So much going on. After a first watch, I think a few of the scenes could probably have been cut a little shorter but I don't know... I need to watch again. And I *want* to watch it again.

I felt Nic Cage's particular brand of acting fit perfectly...

<span style=""background-color: black"">I think the bathroom scene, even though a little out of place, is such a classic Nic Cage scene. Jarring, the acting in that scenes was... not good, but so Nic Cage. </span>

I knew going in that this was probably going to be a movie I'd like, but had prepared myself to be disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed at all. I think this is destined to be a cult classic.,_Mandy_ is very much my sort of movie. but it's still not perfect to me. Every trope that makes up _Mandy_, the neon, the synth, the gore, whatever gimmick nonsense, safe to assume I loved it. But _Mandy_ takes **so long** to get going. Normally that's not a mark against a movie in my book, but here's my problem: The entire first half of the movie that's all set-up, gave me absolutely no feel for the relationship between the two leads. It should be the most important part of the movie, it's the impetus for every worthwhile even that happened, but I honestly don't even know if they like each other. There was so much time to explore that dynamic, and they basically never did.

But then the real movie kicks in and that wasted time is sort of forgotten and you just enjoy that great, dumb, aesthetic shit.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,This is ""style over substance"" done to the extreme. While visually stunning, even hauntingly beautiful at times, there's utterly no point to any of it. Add to that the ridiculous and sometimes painful dialogue and extremely slow pacing, and you got quite a mess in my book. Now, that is not to say it does not have any redeeming qualities - the visual aspect is one, so is the soundtrack. And, well, Nick Cage is .. well, Nick Cage. (YOU RIPPED MY SHIRT?!)

I have to assume it is an inspired watch if --and only if-- you're watching it while higher than high. That must also have been the state of those who made it, let alone greenlit and financed it, because despite having so very little to offer in terms of storytelling, it must have cost an arm and a leg to film and produce.

Anyway. Unless you are extremely into artsy, pretentious, drawn-out gore-fests, give this a wide berth.,Being very intrigued and in parts fascinated with Beyond the Black Rainbow from a pure cinephile perspective, I was quite eager to see a new film by Panos Cosmatos. After learning about Mandy and what it was about, and seeing it being a bigger budget and more thought-out endeavour, I was of course very eager to see it. After finally watching Mandy it feels to me that Panos Cosmatos failed to deliver on the promise of his first film's virtues, and actually re-established his weaknesses as a director. Not that this is a negative opinion on this film overall. Just explaining how and why Mandy failed my high expectations. Take those sentiments as you will. Besides elements familiar from his first film, with very carefully stylized and mostly beautiful shots and scenes overall, a dreamlike, menacing and off-worldly setting, slow and meditative pace, Mandy also managed to surprise me on several levels. I really appreciated how Mandy, the character, was written and performed, like sort of a person who naturally dislikes and distrusts people. I think Andrea Riseborough did a brilliant job here, although physically, she appeared a bit anorexic to me. I don’t know if she had weight issues that year, and I usually don’t care about those things, but in this particular case her appearance felt a bit jarring to me. But I digress. Other things that majorly surprised me is how the cult was realistically portrayed (if we ignore the biker gang), for better or worse. It's like they were very purposely demystified, in every possible opportunity. And all that in the setting of mystification and stylistic painting of the world as fantastical, which confused the hell out of me. And nothing in this regard changes toward the end. The director, I feel, even chooses to emphasize on this more and more as the movie goes on. It's worth mentioning that Cage's performance, while excellent, was not ""baroque"", how he calls some of his wild performances, but very controlled, adding little to film’s unearthly atmosphere. Most importantly, Mandy felt like a film with huge problems in both pace and elements that are tonally very disjointed, while each of these elements separately is excellent (faux fantastical setting versus the ugly reality of cult members' character and actions). Also, the part with the chemist really breaks down the narrative, in my opinion. That segment almost feels botched on purpose, Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse style, which is one of the main things I disliked in their double-feature. Still, Mandy contains plenty of fascinating parts for the film to be worthy of re-watching, and is not dull or tedious in anyway. There is some point to Mandy’s fascination with pulp fantasy novels, and Red’s subsequent revenge portrayed as a fantastical quest, but this curious idea alone doesn’t help to liven up the film. Like I said earlier, this approach just doesn’t chafe well with the cult remaining a group of barely threatening and very flawed individuals. Especially given the fact Red managed to overpower a much more dangerous and menacing group earlier in the film. The movie simply fails to ramp up in any manner toward the end, while the story and style demands that. Finally, it’s just not the cult film I expected to see, and I think a lot of people felt the same, given the lukewarm scores. A kinetic, relentless, wild film, what it should have been. At least in its last third. It's just too...stilted. And sadly, I sense this is more a limitation of Cosmatos, than a strong, firm decision on his part. I am now much less excited after seeing Mandy about Cosmatos’ next film, and I think he failed to put himself on the map with Mandy. The future will show.,_By JD Phillips, geekr.org_

I think this is the strangest review I might ever write. Mostly because the film in question is a strange experience, unlike most others. It's simultaneously a brilliant piece of 80’s horror art and an overindulgent mess that never figures itself out outside its influences. Basically, it’s a film where it makes perfect sense for Nicolas Cage to scream, cry, laugh menacingly, and chug a whole bottle of vodka while on the toilet, wearing a tiger t-shirt and his tighty whities.


If that sounds horrible to you or if it sounds brilliant to you, you’re right.


You can tell within seconds that this movie is going to be a trippy arthouse ride like you’ve never seen before. Anyone familiar with director Panos Cosmatos knows his films are basically like falling through a portal on the side of a heavy metal album cover. It’s a dark 80’s grindhouse fantasy horror fest that is powerfully immersive in ways that most films don’t come close to.


Whether you are watching scenes that take place within the Charles Mansonesque Jesus Freak cult, the animated tripfests, or Nicolas Cage chainsaw fighting (yes, you read that right) with a Mad Max style BDSM demon, you will find it nearly impossible to take your eyes off the screen.


That’s not to say that what you are watching will entirely be worth that attention. In the end, the film definitely feels like it’s more style over substance. It never feels like it ever reaches the heights that it sets up. It relies too much on cliches from the genre it loves to ever truly be more than a beautiful homage. If you don’t have a special place in your heart for heavy metal music and grindhouse action, there just won’t be much here for you.


That’s not to say that the cast doesn’t give their all to prove themselves. Nicolas Cage gives his most insane performance to date. Fans of his from films like “Raising Arizona” or “Adaptation” won’t find that actor here. Fans who love to watch clips of him being a mad-eyed psycho in “The Wicker Man” or “Face/Off” will want to watch this film immediately. The man forges a battle axe and takes on the forces of evil with bloody rage as you’ve never seen before.


The film drives into the actor’s wackiness and this time it really works. This is definitely a film that needed Nicolas Cage. Maybe if “Ghost Rider” would’ve embraced the B-movie potential of its star, that film would be more memorable.


The rest of the cast is pretty excellent too. Andrea Riseborough shines as the titular Mandy. She brings a unique but grounded style to the character that makes you understand why these men fall in love with her so heavily. Speaking of, Linus Roache’s cult leader Jeremiah Sand might be the best part of the whole movie.


Fans of “Vikings” will be pleased to hear that Roache once again throws himself into a creepily sexual role with both feet. It’s hard to match the level of weird Nicolas Cage can bring, but Roache gives him a run for his money. It doesn’t hurt that Jeremiah Sand is the best-written character of the bunch.


The rest of the cult members are pitch perfect in their roles. They all look like the director went to a bunch of real-life cults and picked his favorites. Each one brings a different kind of creep factor that really elevates the film.


In the end, “Mandy” is a wonderfully made love letter to its genre even if it fails to redefine said genre as much as it potentially could have. Its particular brand of artful bloody wackiness may not be for everyone, but those that love that sort of thing will have one hell of a good ride.


**6.0 OR 9.0**
_(DEPENDING ON WHICH WAY YOUR BREAD IS BUTTERED)_
,Ok, I can see what Panos Cosmatos is going for; riding the 80s vibe but going for heavy metal instead of synthwave. Set in the eighties, there are plenty of references to the cultural conglomerate of the era with glam/speed/heavy metal and fantasy art, b-action machoismo, outsiderness and self-imposed isolation. It is even haunted by the counter culture seventies with the vicious religious hippie cult and their LSD fueled motorcycle gang lackeys. 

Though anachronistic, I can see Mandy as an attempt of a drone or sludge metal album in a movie format or concert experience, as said were more a nineties evolution. The key elements are there for all senses; excessive slow tempo, cross processed colors, heavy distortions, huge delays and massive reverbs. 

Unfortunately it loses itself in this gloss and ends up superficial and pretty with more tiresome slow motion that an entire season of sport of your choice. The story churns from A to B with little character or evolution. The raw expositions become flat and pretentious. The violence that should be shocking becomes a tedious grind without any build up or tension. 

Honestly, I wanted to like this movie. I tried to watch it as a art flick by an auteur director, as a hommage to an era and even as a deadpan pastiche. I don't know what I'm missing, because for me it ends up not a denim and studs speedball but rather a pubescent fever dream through an instagram filter. 

Had it not been for the multiple credible names involved and the over the top stylistic finish, I think it would have passad as a retro exploitation revenge flick without much attention.,This is one weird movie. I have to confess that I am quite a fan of Nicholas Cage. I know he has made more than his share of really crappy movies but I can not help myself. When I see a movie with him in the lead role I still have to watch it. This movie is one of those.

There are definitely some interesting cinematic aspects to this movie. As a piece of cinematic art I would say that it is not bad at all. However, it is definitely weird and whoever wrote this script, well he was on drugs when he wrote it, there is no doubt in my mind about that.

It is part a grindhouse movie in the spirit of Tarantino and Rodriguez and part a far out  psychedelic visual experience. I do not regret watching it. It was a experience if nothing else. Was it a good movie in general? No, not really. The 3 out of 5 score from me is barely and it is largely due to the cinematics, a few cool (and violent) scenes and Nicholas Cage.

The movie seems to focus on delivering one weird scene after another. There is not really any explanation to most things. I especially would have liked to know more about and get more of a conclusion on this (supernatural?) bike gang. But they just show up and then they kind of disappear from the story.

The main bad-guy is an absolute nut-case but we never really get to understand what drives this weirdo. He has created some cult with a few followers but that is about it. His demise, although satisfactory, is just a show of insanity.

In short the movie is a mix of heavy metal, horror, violence and psychedelic weirdness and I would say that the audience for this movie is a quite small group of people. I’m not really sure that I am in that group.,**_Entertainingly insane_**

> **Nick Allen**: _As a viewer, you step into a movie like this and you’re excited for its genre spectacle, but then you find out that it’s really sensitive. I was wondering how important that was to you, to have that more gentle nature?_
> 
> **Panos Cosmatos**: _It was very important to me. I didn't want to make a purely testosterone-driven man film at all. I wanted to make a movie that everybody could connect with on some personal level. From that, I drew a little bit on my own relationship with my wife, where there are these moments where you're happy, and_ _you're alone together. Being in each other's presence. I really like the part where they're watching TV, because it feels like something everyone does with their significant other. Nobody goes horseback riding, that I know of. You eat and watch TV, or where I feel the most close to my wife._

> **Allen**: _It's interesting that you say you didn't want to make a big manly movie, as Mandy seems to play with the macho aspect of it, whether it's different sizes of weapons, or Jeremiah's entitlement to Mandy. Did you talk a lot about that with your actors, or with co-writer Aaron Stewart-Ahn, when you were writing it?_
>
> **Cosmatos**: _Yeah, well we were interested in the male ego and what a nightmarish, poisonous mushroom that can be. But I wanted the audience, the last thing on earth I wanted to do was make a movie that plays directly to a sort-of frat boy audience, you know? I feel like if those people want to enjoy the movie, then they have to earn their way to that. Spending time with Red and Mandy, and connect with them on every level that you can. Don't get me wrong, I think there's pleasure to be had in things in our film, I just didn't want the film to just have solely stuff for that audience._

- ""Panos Cosmatos on Crafting his Heavy Metal Valentine, _Mandy_"" (Nick Allen); _RogerEbert.com_ (September 12, 2018)

Equal parts psychotropic horror and grindhouse revenge thriller, _Mandy_ is what you might get if David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, and Andrei Tarkovsky teamed up to remake Michael Winner's _Death Wish_ (1974) in the style of a Giallo. The second feature from director and co-writer Panos Cosmatos, after the interesting, but not entirely convincing _Beyond the Black Rainbow_ (2010), _Mandy_ is a psychedelic experience in pretty much every way, and as midnight-y as a midnight B-movie could possibly be. And although it would be impossible to recommend to everyone, there is an undeniable brilliance here. An insane brilliance. But a brilliance none-the-less. Although it could (somewhat legitimately) be accused of too much style and not enough substance, Cosmatos pitch-perfectly mixes an expressionist aesthetic with horror tropes, a generic revenge narrative, and comedy beats. But let's face it, the reason most people will see the film is for Nicholas Cage, and in that sense, _Mandy_ joins the ranks of films such as Robert Bierman's _Vampire's Kiss_ (1988), Werner Herzog's _Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call – New Orleans_ (2009) and Brian Taylor's _Mom and Dad_ (2017) in giving Cage an organic, narratively justified reason to go full-Cage, digging deep into his reservoir of batshit insanity. And that's never a bad thing.

Set in ""1983 A.D."", the film tells the story of Red Miller (Cage), and his girlfriend, aspiring fantasy artist Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough), who live a simple secluded life in the Shadow Mountains, in a cabin on the banks of Crystal Lake. Hugely supportive of one another, it's hinted that Red may have been an alcoholic and/or drug addict in his youth, whilst Mandy has a significant facial scar, possibly the result of a troubled childhood, which she alludes to from time to time. All is calm in their life until Mandy is spotted by the Children of the New Dawn, a religious cult led by failed folk singer Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache). Taken with Mandy's beauty, Sand tells his right-hand-man, Brother Swan (Ned Dennehy), that he wants Mandy, saying ""_you know what to do_."" Using the ""Horn of Abraxas"", Swan summons the Black Skulls, a trio of demonic bikers addicted to a highly potent form of LSD, and along with the Skulls, the Children invade Red and Mandy's cabin, tying Red up in barbed wire outside, and leaving him for dead. Meanwhile, two female Children, Mother Marlene (Olwen Fouéré) and Sister Lucy (Line Pillet), drug Mandy with LSD and venom from a giant wasp, before presenting her to Sand. Singing his own song, ""Amulet of the Weeping Maze"", Sand attempts to seduce Mandy, but things quickly go awry when he proves unable to get an erection. Unbeknownst to the Children, however, Red has survived and set out in pursuit of both the cult and the Skulls.

One of the things that will jump out at you as you watch _Mandy_ is that Cosmatos packs the narrative with an extraordinary amount of cultural references, some oblique, others more obvious. Prior to hearing any dialogue, there is an audio extract of President Ronald Reagan speaking about how the vast majority of Americans are disgusted by porn. Mandy's art is not dissimilar to the work of Roger Dean, whilst the film's animated sections (of which there are several) recall the kind of material found in _Heavy Metal_. Indeed, the general aesthetic of the film is equal parts _Bat Out of Hell_ and Iron Maiden. The Children of the New Dawn cult is obviously inspired by the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ and the Manson Family, with Sand himself part Jim Jones, part Charles Manson, and part Dan Fogelberg. The home invasion scene bears more than a passing resemblance to similar such scenes in Wes Craven's _The Last House on the Left_ (1972) and John McNaughton's _Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer_ (1986), whilst the revenge narrative has something of George Miller's original _Mad Max_ (1979) about it. The film also recalls Nicholas Winding Refn's _Valhalla Rising_ (2009) in places. Sand's ""Amulet of the Weeping Maze"" is inspired by the work of The Carpenters (which he admits himself). Red is seen wearing a Mötley Crüe t-shirt, and tells an awesome Erik Estrada/_CHiPs_ (1977-1983) joke. During a discussion about which planet is their favourite, Mandy selects Jupiter, but Red argues for Galactus. The Black Skulls are obviously inspired by the Cenobites from Clive Barker's _Hellraiser_ (1987). The Children's A-frame chapel resembles the church in Paul Thomas Anderson's _There Will Be Blood_ (2009). This is as culturally-literate a film as you're likely to see all year, and as much as the narrative exists in a kind of shattered-mirror version of reality, these references do help ground it, even if many of them are purposely anachronistic.

_Mandy_ gets off to a cracking start by using the old Universal logo, complete with scratches and dirt on the celluloid. It follows that up with the most pseudo-John Carpenter 80s music imaginable, composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson (_Sicario_; _Arrival_; _mother!_), in one of his last compositions prior to his untimely death, with guitar chords played by Stephen O'Malley of Sunn 0))). To give you an idea of the type of music featured throughout the film, there's an early shot moving across the forest scored to King Crimson's ""Starless"". Indeed, the score is almost another character entirely, and the film simply wouldn't work half as well if the music wasn't as good.

Aside from the music, the most immediately attention-grabbing aspect of the film is the use of colour, with director of photography Benjamin Loeb's compositions bathed in deep purples, reds, indigos, yellows, greens, and oranges, with the occasional blue (primarily associated with Mandy herself). Often the colours are non-diegetic and unexplained (for example the Horn of Abraxas always appears in green light, irrespective of location). The cinematography also employs a plethora of subjective techniques, such as double lens flares, animation, slow-motion fades and dissolves, telephoto shots, what can only be described as psychedelic lighting, and a hell of a lot of dry ice.

Very much a film of two halves, if the first brings us the gates to hell, the second pushes us in and slams the gates shut behind us. The first half runs up until just prior to the beginning of Red's revenge, whilst the second depicts that revenge. The first half focuses primarily on Mandy, with Red very much a supporting character, whilst the second, obviously, focuses on him. However, it's not just in terms of narrative content in which the two halves differ, they are also aesthetically different, particularly the editing rhythms. The first is languid and dream-like, almost graceful, whilst the second is like something out of Dante Alighieri or William Blake, filtered through H.R. Giger on acid. The two halves are divided by an extraordinary single-shot 45-second scene of Red (wearing only underpants and a t-shirt) pouring vodka all over his wounds, drinking what's left, and screaming. It's a scene of extraordinarily raw emotion that works brilliantly, partly because scenes like it are so rare. You simply don't often see a male protagonist this vulnerable. This is _Mandy_'s ""suit up"" scene, and here is Cage crying like a starving baby. It's a brave choice by both actor and director, and it works perfectly both as a stand-alone scene and as a transition from the first to the second half of the film. Indeed, it's not beyond the realms of possibility that one could read _Mandy_, at least in part, as a meditation on the destructive nature of profound grief, and if so, that interpretation begins right here. Yes, there is more than a hint of an archetypal dualistic cosmology underpinning Red's revenge, particularly Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, but so too is it a deeply personalised quest.

Especially in the second half of the film (and particularly in the last few minutes), Cosmatos strives to place us in Red's head, which has the effect of elevating the carnage beyond that of your standard ultra-violent revenge movie. As Red's mission progresses, and he becomes more and more unhinged, so too does the film become less and less interested in what we would refer to as reality, introducing such aspects as cannibalism, a bow named ""The Reaper"" and arrows which ""_cut through bone like a fat kid through cake_"", a chemist who can smell where the Black Skulls are, a stoned tiger, eels, a cigarette being lit via a flaming body part, choking via knife, (several) decapitations, a chainsaw duel, a church in the forest with secret underground passages, a skull crushing, hallucinations, even a cosmic event.

There are some problems, however. For starters, it's kind of disappointing when you realise that for all its technical prowess and fascinating aesthetic gymnastics, when it comes down to it, _Mandy_ is just a revenge flick, and at just over two hours, it tends to drag a little in places. The screenplay (by Cosmatos and Aaron Stewart-Ahn) can also be too on the nose at tunes. For example, early in the film, Mandy tells a story about her father attempting to force her to kill a baby starling that proves tonally prophetic in the way only stories in films ever doesn't give Red a huge amount of depth.

Is there an element of the emperor's new clothes about the entire endeavour? Yes, to a certain extent there is. And, yes, most of the best bits are in the trailer (or at least are spoiled by the trailer – the chainsaw duel would have been much funnier if I hadn't known it was coming). And yes, it's all kind of pointless. However, love it or loathe it, there's no denying it's brilliantly assembled. As an audio-visual experience, it's unlike anything I've seen in a long time, and it's almost certainly destined for cult status.,""Mandy"" is a surreal mind trip of a movie.

When a skeevy cult leader lusts after and kidnaps Mandy after a random drive by, the inner ""Cage"" beast is released.

Hollywood has always had a curious relationship with colonialism. Whilst the British colonisation of the Americas tends to be frowned upon, one of the most popular genres of all-time, the western, was, for many decades, an un-ironic celebration of the white mans' subjugation of the Native American populace. It was only with the revisionist westerns of directors such as John Ford, John Sturges, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone that the genre began to embrace introspection, deconstructing its own codes and rendering problematic its colonialist tropes. Written and directed by Jennifer Kent, _The Nightingale_ could certainly be categorised as a revisionist western, albeit set in Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania), an island about 150 miles off the southeast coast of Australia, but it's probably more accurate to class it as a colonial revenge. On the surface, it's very much a genre picture, a rape/revenge drama set in a western _milieu_. However, as it progresses, it gradually reveals itself as less concerned with hitting genre beats than engaging with issues such as racism, misogyny, innocence, the fine line between barbarism and civilisation, and the cathartic potential of violent revenge (or possible lack thereof). Much as Kent's debut, the exceptional _The Babadook_ (2014), was a horror in name only, its genre serving as a means to a thematic end, so too with _The Nightingale_. Brutally violent (but never gratuitously so), extremely unpleasant, and downright nihilistic at times, it's not going to pack them in at the multiplex, but for those who think of cinema as art first, entertainment second, this is an important, relevant, and mature study of mans' innate capacity for cruelty.

Van Diemen's Land, 1825. A British penal colony, the island is in the midst of the Black War, with the British army attempting to eradicate the indigenous Palawa population. In an isolated colony, Clare Carroll (a star-making turn from Aisling Franciosi) and her husband Aidan (Michael Sheasby) are Irish convicts with an infant daughter, indentured to garrison commander Lt. Hawkins (an odious Sam Claflin). Convicted of petty theft in Ireland over seven years prior, Clare has served her sentence and is waiting for Hawkins to sign her long overdue letter of recommendation, which would render her and Aidan free citizens. However, Hawkins, who calls her his Nightingale on account of her beautiful singing voice, responds by raping her, and not for the first time. Meanwhile, Cpt. Goodwin (Ewen Leslie) visits the colony to evaluate Hawkins for promotion and a more prestigious command. The night after the rape, Aidan drinks too much and gets into a brawl with Hawkins, the sadistic Sgt. Ruse (Damon Herriman), and the naïve Pvt. Jago (Harry Greenwood). Seeing the brawl, and already unimpressed with the conduct of Hawkins's men, Goodwin tells him he will not be recommending him for promotion. Infuriated, Hawkins orders Ruse and Jago to accompany him on foot through the treacherous bush to Launceston, where he intends to make an in-person appeal for promotion to army brass. However, before they leave, Hawkins and Ruse rape Clare and brutalise Aidan and their baby. And so, determined to exact revenge, she sets off in pursuit of the trio, hiring ""Billy"" Mangana (an exceptional debut from dancer Baykali Ganambarr), a Palawa tracker and one of the last of his people, who hates whites as much as Clare hates Hawkins.

Having spent over five years researching the frontier wars, Kent made _The Nightingale_ in collaboration with Palawa elders, with the story of Clare and Billy serving as Australia-specific synecdoche for the general oppression and violence of British colonialism. Both Clare and Billy have been deeply wronged by colonialists – her as a convict and woman, him as a Palawa. However, one of Kent's masterstrokes is to complicate their dynamic, whereby neither is capable of seeing their similarity to one another, with both convinced their racist point of view is legitimate. When Clare is first told she'll need a Palawa tracker, she responds, ""_I'm not travelling with a black. I'll end up in someone's pot of dinner_"". And in literally the next scene, when Clare tries to hire Billy, his response is, ""_I'm not working for a bloody white woman._"" It doesn't matter to him that Clare is in Van Diemen's Land against her will – she's part of the white race that has murdered his people and taken his land. At the same time, her view of him is based on the crudest of colonial stereotypes – that all Aborigines are cannibalistic savages. Indeed, for much of the first half of the film, she refers to him as ""_boy_"" rather than his actual name and exerts her authority over him in a not entirely dissimilar manner to how Hawkins exerts his authority over her.

However, it's not exactly a spoiler to say that much of the film concerns itself with the duo coming to understand the oppression experienced by the other, recognising their parallel experiences. Indeed, in one of the strongest scenes in the film, their first real connection comes as they sit at an open fire, each cursing their oppressors in their respective native tongue, linguistically rebelling by rejecting the colonial signifiers and codes. In the hands of a lesser director, their story arcs could easily devolve into the worst kind of facile and clichéd movie sentimentality. Kent, however, keeps everything so grounded in bleak reality, the character beats so organic, and the themes so understated (there are no ""cry now"" moments), that virtually every stage of the relationship rings true, with unnecessary, authorial imposed plot never overwhelming characterisation.

Hawkins, for his part, is a representative of the worst aspects of British colonialism, not just the kind of jingoistic and xenophobic thinking that made such colonialism possible, but so too the misogyny, racism, and savagery that underpinned the formation of the largest empire in human history (at its largest (around 1920), the British Empire included 23% of the world's population and covered 24% of the globe). Crucially, however, Hawkins is utterly banal; believing himself destined for greatness, he's incapable of accepting what is apparent to Goodwin and the audience – he's a poor officer, an amoral and mediocre man whose lofty ambitions infinitely outweigh his negligible potential. He's a symbol of the toxic masculinity that engendered colonialism, but so too is he a flesh-and-blood person with characteristics relatively unrelated to his savagery. This is important insofar as, yes, he's an irredeemable monster, but he's never a pantomime villain.

Although, on the surface, _The Nightingale_ is a rape/revenge genre piece, Kent argues that this is to miscategorise the film, telling _BUILD_,

>_it's being classed as a rape/revenge film because it's got rape in it and people who are feeling the need for vengeance, but it doesn't follow any of the tropes of that genre. In fact, if people who like those kinds of films come and see it, they're going to be infinitely disappointed, because it provides no catharsis. It actually kicks up the question of why are you wanting revenge in that way. Do you really believe it? It's a fantasy, this idea that revenge provides catharsis, it's largely a fantasy._

This is an important point, as one of the film's main themes is whether revenge can lead to peace of mind. Does revenge provide fleeting satisfaction, even though it's ultimately futile, or is it a necessary and important part of the healing process? Most troublingly of all, however, Kent asks, irrespective of one's awareness of the heavy psychological cost of violent revenge, are there acts which are so abhorrent, inhuman, and evil that revenge is the only possible response. And if so, how does one reconcile the futility of revenge with its necessity?

From an aesthetic point of view, as one would expect from the makers of _The Babadook_, _The Nightingale_ looks exceptional. Kent and cinematographer Radek Ladczuk shot the film in Academy ratio (1.37:1), with the claustrophobic nearly square frame trapping the characters within it, in direct opposition to the vast open plains in which they often find themselves. Especially important are the BCUs of faces, particularly the recurring motif of shooting from above characters as they lie on their back looking up into the sky, usually at night time. Faces in general, and Clare's in particular, are the film's roadmap insofar as the violence is never abstract; it happens to a person, not a depersonalised body, and it has real consequences – compare, for example, Clare's face prior to and after the second rape, with Franciosi's exceptionally modulated performance communicating more than language ever could. Indeed, the economy of Kent's visual language is evident from the opening scene, which sees Clare walking through the bush with her baby, as the camera shows us she's carrying a knife – establishing her independence and strength of character whilst also communicating how dangerous this place is, all without a word of dialogue.

Much has been made of the film's violence, particularly the scene where Hawkins and Ruse rape Clare. At both screenings at the Sydney Film Festival, multiple audience members walked out, and North American distributors IFC included a trigger warning independent of the MPAA rating details, stating, ""The Nightingale _features potentially triggering acts of sexual violence towards women, violence towards children and violence motivated by racism._"" Personally, although I found the rape scenes disturbing, I didn't think they were as bad as has been made out, and if you've survived films such as Wes Craven's _The Last House on the Left_ (1972), Lukas Moodysson's _Lilja-4-ever_ (2002), or Gaspar Noé's _Irréversible_, you'll be fine with _The Nightingale_. In any case, the violence (whether sexual or otherwise) is never gratuitous, exploitative, or immature – Kent is no Quentin Tarantino; violence in her work has stomach-churning consequences, and when she chooses to show such violence, there is always a point, whether it be thematic or character-driven, it's never arbitrary violence-for-violence's-sake, or worse, violence-for-titillation's-sake.

In terms of problems, as the Sydney screenings attest, the brutality on display will simply be too much for some – this most definitely is not a date movie, or a popcorn movie, or a popcorn date movie – it's dark, brutal, and unrelenting and it asks a lot of the audience. I didn't see this as a problem myself, but certainly, some people believe cinema should entertain, and entertain only, and if you're of that mindset, you'll get nothing from _The Nightingale_. A more objective criticism is that at 136 minutes, it's a tad too long, and it does lapse into repetition from time to time – if the middle act had been tightened up a bit, cutting maybe 10 or 15 minutes, it would have played better. The _dénouement_ is also somewhat rote, which is disappointing given the strength of the filmmaking leading us to that point. I wouldn't necessarily say it doesn't work, but it's the only part of the where it feels like a genre piece.

These issues aside, however, this is exceptionally strong filmmaking. With not a hint of sentimentality in its unflinching depiction of the horrors inherent in the subjugation of an entire people, _The Nightingale_ confirms Kent as a major _auteur_ with a distinctive voice and the courage to remain true to her subject-matter, however abhorrent such truth might be.,Jennifer Kent delivered one of the best horror movies of the decade, The Babadook. With The Nightingale, only her second feature film, she offers one of the most visually brutal, shocking, jaw-dropping, violent revenge stories ever. This movie is the definition of “not for everyone.”

But a funny thing happens every so often, one tends to surprise. Final Score, albeit can get silly at times, was quite fun and entertaining.

Dave Bautista plays Michael Knox, a former soldier visiting his “brother’s” widowed wife and daughter, Danni (LARA PEAKE), whose father was killed during a mission led by Knox. He’s come to take Danni to a football (soccer) game.

Meanwhile, Arkady Belav (RAY STEVENSON) and his merry men of terrorists, infiltrate the stadium for the match. Belav learns that his brother, Dimitri (PIERCE BROSNAN), had faked his death 17 years earlier in order to stop the bloodshed during a revolution in the Russian state of Sakovya for independence. Arkady believes once the people see Dimitri alive, despite undergoing heavy plastic surgery to look a lot like Pierce Brosnan, will rise up and the revolution will be revitalized.

Arkady and his crew have not only jammed signals so people inside cannot get use their cell phones, they have also rigged columns in the stadium with C4 explosives. Once Knox gets wind of what’s going on, he goes into action first to protect Danni and then take down Arkady, with the help of stadium attendant Faisal (AMIT SHAH), who knows the lay of the land. Brutal violence ensues.

I don’t mind admitting, I genuinely enjoyed Final Score. It’s a movie that certainly had more than a few silly moments, most notably Knox riding a motorbike onto a heavy fabric roof along with some eye-rolling dialogue, one towards the end that reminded me of the “swing high” line in Signs. But even so, Dave Bautista has proven he does have enough charisma to carry a movie while Ray Stevenson, to no one’s surprise, does play an effective villain even when his character’s motives don’t seem to be well thought out. And finally Pierce Brosnan gets the prestigious “and” credit meaning he’s only in the film for a few minutes and minimal dialogue, but even so, seems to give it his best for such a limited part. As much as I liked Stevenson, kind of wish Brosnan played the villain here…

Final Score was directed by Scott Mann who also helmed the dull film Heist from 2015 (which co-starred Bautista) but here the action was pretty well shot and even in the asinine moments, were still rather suspenseful. The script was written by “The Lynch Brothers” (David and Keith Lynch; both making their feature debuts) and Mann’s co-to man, Jonathan Frank who wrote Mara also for Saban Films.

In the end, this is not some tremendous action-thriller and certainly does have shades of Die Hard, but even so, I was generally surprised considering the track record for these direct-to-video flicks that are more often than not, are terrible. This one, was actually pretty damn good.,Might not exactly be a masterpiece, but for real: Ray Stevenson and Craig Conway as Eurotrash terrorists taking on Dave Bautista at a Hammers game in a ""_Die-Hard_-But"" movie with a kickass soundtrack? This is thing is one neon lights sequence away from being literally made for me.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._,***Unpredictable bleak Alaskan adventure, mystery, thriller***

An author and wolf expert (Jeffrey Wright) arrives at a remote village in Alaska to help rid the town of a wolf problem that has resulted in a few dead children. Riley Keough plays the troubled mother and Alexander Skarsgård her taciturn husband coming home from Iraq. James Badge Dale appears as the local sheriff while Julian Black Antelope is on hand as a curious AmerIndian named Cheeon.

""Hold the Dark"" (2018) is a combination mystery/drama/adventure/thriller/horror. It’s original, unpredictable and dead serious with elements of movies like “The Grey” (2011), “Runaway Train” (1985), “Wendigo” (2001), “The Frozen Ground” (2013), “The North Star” (1996), “Joyride” (1977) and “The Edge” (1997), not to mention a “Apocalypse Now” (or Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness) and even a little from the “Friday the 13th” franchise, albeit without the goofiness. Imagine if the band Agalloch made a movie and that’s pretty much “Hold the Dark” (there’s even a snippet from an Agalloch-like band in the movie).

It’s based on the book by William Giraldi and some viewers have complained that key revelations weren’t obvious enough in the film. Well, I never read the book and wasn’t able to figure out these revelations, but this didn’t prevent me from appreciating this artistic nigh masterpiece. Afterward, I looked-up the revelations and they put the pieces of the puzzle together; yet the clues are all there (in the movie) if you watch closely. My wife watched the film separately and WAS able to glean these revelations. But, again, not being able to figure out every detail did NOT prevent me from valuing this great movie.

The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada (Lethbridge & Calgary), and Morocco.

- Brady Corbet; ""Vox Lux's Brady Corbet on Making One of the Most Polarising Movies of the Year"" (Charles Bramesco); _Vulture_ (December 7, 2018)

A story about popular art born amidst violent trauma. A thriller about the remorseless and cannibalistic machinations of fame. An allegory for the calcification of celebrity-obsessed American society. A study of the interactions between pop culture and global terrorism. A _bildungsroman_ about the possible consequences of a troubled childhood. A dark fairy tale about the music industry. A threnody for a pre-Columbine and 9/11 world. The bold, wildly ambitious _Vox Lux_ is all of these. And more. Written by former actor Brady Corbet and his partner Mona Fastvold, and directed by Corbet, the film takes the basic _A Star is Born_ template, and gives it an angry and bitter 21st-century makeover, mercilessly torpedoing Bradley Cooper's whimsical paean to Old Hollywood romanticism into neon-soaked glitter-adorned oblivion. As a director, Corbet exploded onto the scene in 2015 with the sensational, out-of-nowhere _The Childhood of a Leader_, a visually stunning examination of the birth of 20th-century fascism from 19th-century aristocracy. And although _Vox Lux_, a film about a contemporary pop star, seems to have no thematic connection to _Childhood_, there are marked similarities between the two films - they both examine troubled formative childhood years intertwined with global tragedy that ultimately produce less than admirable adults; they both use the specifics of a small group of people to synecdochally engage with larger socio-political issues; they both unapologetically indict a culture in its death throes; they are both fundamentally built on asking questions without providing answers; neither is especially interested in conventional psychology or character arcs. There are a couple of problems (the film could be accused of relying too heavily on voiceover; it strays into cliché on occasion; it's front-loaded, with the best scenes happening in the first act; it walks a very fine line between portentousness and pretentiousness), but all things considered, this is another superb film from a director who, at only 30, is already a unique and exciting cinematic voice.

Divided into four parts (""Prelude - 1999""; ""Act I: Genesis - 2000-2001""; ""Act II: Regenesis - 2017""; and ""Finale - XXI"") the story begins on Staten Island in 1999, with a student opening fire in his school. 13-year-old Celeste Montgomery (Raffey Cassidy) tries to talk him down, but is shot in the throat. Although she survives, the bullet is lodged in such a way as to make it impossible to remove, and thus she will be in permanent pain for the rest of her life. Several months later, at a memorial service for the slain students, Celeste sings a song written by herself and her elder sister Eleanor (Stacy Martin). The performance goes viral, and draws the attention of a talented, if not entirely scrupulous, manager (Jude Law), with Celeste suddenly finding herself on the fast track to global superstardom. With Act I concluding with 9/11, the film then jumps to Croatia in 2017, as a terrorist group open fire on a beach. Wearing masks similar to those worn in one of her first music videos, the bad publicity comes as the now adult Celeste (Natalie Portman), a neurotic, self-obsessed, and barely functioning alcoholic, is putting the finishing touches to a new album and preparing for a massive concert and tour. Her mood isn't helped by her fraught relationships with her own teenage daughter Albertine (also played by Cassidy), her manager, her publicist Josie (Jennifer Ehle), and Eleanor, who has basically raised Albertine. When asked by a reporter (Christopher Abbott) about the terrorist attack in Croatia, Celeste makes an offhand comment that seems to invite an attack at her show later that night, sending her behind-the-scenes people into a tailspin as they try to decide whether to go ahead with the concert.

Aesthetically, as one would expect from the director of _Childhood_, there's all manner of things to be fascinated by in _Vox Lux_. The film's temporal structure, for example; whereas the Prelude and Act I cover about two years, followed by a 16-year gap, Act II and the Finale take place over the course of roughly eight hours. There's also the voiceover (provided by Willem Dafoe). The existential, adjective-heavy, and almost ""_once upon a time_""-like quality to the narration is the very definition of purple prose, but it works magnificently in context. For example, the film begins with,

Considering her parents' background, education, and socioeconomic status, being somewhat on the losing side of Reaganomics, the name of Latin origin seemed an especially poetic choice. It carved her out some predetermined destination, a route by which to travel. But many years before ""Celeste"" rolled off the cultural tongue like a principled anecdote one senses they were born knowing, she might not have been described as all that special or conspicuously talented. However, she did possess that proverbial ""something,"" which on occasion captured the attention of her teachers and young peers._

The narration does have an important thematic purpose, however, serving as a kind of omniscient chorus on events, with Dafoe describing it as ""_an important tonal element and framing device. It's a kind of go-between with the audience_"". Also aesthetically important is the music. The unashamedly over-produced and plastic songs sung by Celeste are all written by Sia (although they're performed by Cassidy and Portman), whilst the score is provided by the legendary Scott Walker, whose music so elevated the grandeur of _Childhood of a Leader_. He's more restrained and contemplative here, but it's still an exceptionally important component of the film, and represents the last piece of original work before his untimely death earlier this year.

In terms of the acting, there's no weak link. Tapping into some of the same energy she possessed in Darren Aronofsky's _Black Swan_ (2010) and some of the same nuance she showed in Pablo Larraín's _Jackie_ (2016), Portman plays adult Celeste as suitably frazzled. Holding nothing back, her histrionic but always authentic depiction of a woman on the edge of a total breakdown is mesmerising to watch, whilst a concert sequence is as bravura a piece of acting as anything from _Black Swan_. In the dual role of young Celeste and Albertine, Cassidy does enough to differentiate the parts, but not so much as for the roles to seemingly have no connection to one another; her Celeste is all overwhelmed and innocent, struggling to maintain control, whilst her Albertine is stoic and world-weary, mature before her years. Jude Law's unnamed manager is just sleazy enough to be disreputable but just honest enough to be likeable, whilst Jennifer Ehle's Josie is wonderfully _haute_, permanently looking down on pretty much everyone around her, Law in particular.

Thematically, the film's most salient concern is a cynical deconstruction of celebrity and fame, specifically the 21st-century post-reality TV incarnation of such (there's a reason the closing credits give the film the subtitle, ""_A Twenty-First Century Portrait_""). In an era whereby one can become famous for virtually anything, the film is painfully of its time, saying as much about celebrities and the machinery of fame as it does about celebrity-obsessed culture. Important in this is that there's no real attempt to make adult Celeste likeable or sympathetic. Sure, she's very much a product of her time, and she's been forced to live her entire life within the parameters of what happened when she was 13. But she's also emblematic of some of the worst components of her time, and Corbet is unconcerned whether the audience empathises with her; his critique of celebrity works just as well if we despise her and all she represents.

Of course, much of the film's biting satire is tied into the plot itself, with Celeste building a career based off a massacre; gun violence used to sell records (a nice visual representation of this is that Celeste turns the neck scarf she has to wear post-shooting into a glittery accessorised part of her brand). She is literally the beneficiary of tragedy in a world where mass shootings have become so commonplace that they can serve as launch-pads for musical careers. Indeed, Corbet is one of very few American directors operating at the moment who is too young to have really known a world in which such incidents weren't an accepted part of the cultural fabric (he was 11 when Columbine happened), and this feeds into the film's DNA. Although the shooting with which the film opens is fictional, it is obviously based on Columbine (both occur in 1999), whilst the shooting in Croatia seems derived from the 2015 massacre at Port El Kantaoui. And obviously, 9/11 looms large, forming the closing punctuation to Act I, with Corbet able to use the transition to subtly suggest that post-9/11 everything has fundamentally changed.

Celeste herself articulates an important element of the connection between pop culture and mass murder when she says, ""_nihilist radical groups perceived as superstars. If everyone stopped talking about them, they'd disappear_"", which is very reminiscent of the main theme in Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ (1994), and which is an even more pertinent sentiment today than it was in 1994. By way of illustration, think about how most people know the names of the Columbine shooters, or the 2012 Aurora shooter, or the 2017 Las Vegas shooter, or, to get away from the US, the 2011 Utøya shooter. Now think about how many victims from any of those tragedies you can name off the top of your head. People know the names of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; very few know the names of William ""Dave"" Sanders, Jon Curtis, or Jay Gallentine, the Columbine teacher and two janitors who saved over 100 students, at the cost of Sanders's life. _Vox Lux_ doesn't provide any answers to the question of the crossover between pop culture and terrorism - how one might lead to the other, or how both provide opportunities for fame - but that's because there _are_ no easy answers. It's simply the way things are, and Corbet's cynicism emphasises that just because this is the way things are, doesn't mean this is the way they should be. And the irony at the heart of the film is that in 1999, a mass shooting shaped Celeste, but in 2017, Celeste shaped a mass shooting. This is the nightmare of the 21st-century celebrity wheel of time, and it's brilliantly, if distressingly, presented.

There are more grounded engagements with celebrity as well. An early scene, for example, sees Celeste proudly declare that she's ""_in command of [her] own destiny_"", followed immediately by a scene of her vomiting into a toilet after drinking too much. In another scene, Corbet brilliantly nails the drudgery of press junkets that every celebrity seems to despise, with Celeste trying to talk about her album, but all any of the journalists want to talk about is the shooting in Croatia. Another aspect of this, and something the film has in common with Cooper's _A Star is Born_, is that as time goes on, Celeste moves further and further away from her stylistic origin point. Introduced as a good Christian girl into folk music and gentle ballads, when we meet her as an adult, she's an autotuned, silicon amalgamation of Madonna, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga, with her music just one step above boy band quality (as she herself says, ""_I don't want people to have to think too hard. I just want them to feel good_""). However, she's also wildly popular, and her music clearly does make people feel good, even if it says precisely nothing of interest or note (which is, of course, ironic considering that her breakthrough came with a song that spoke volumes to the entire world, giving voice to unspoken collective grief).

In terms of problems, there are a few. Obviously, any film with such lofty aims as mapping the ideological decline of 21st culture onto the rise and fall and rise of a pop star is setting itself a huge task, and at times Corbet's ambitions exceed his reach. Parts of the adult Celeste portion of the film definitely stray into melodrama, and the fact that the first act is so good does make the second seem a little prosaic in comparison (although the Finale is mesmerising). The ambiguity of the first act, which is unclear if Celeste's rise to fame is redemptive or an extension of the evil unleashed in the shooting, gives way in the second to the far more mundane (and clichéd) study of a harried celebrity, and although the totality is satisfying, I couldn't shake the feeling that the first act seemed to be setting up for something upon which the second fails to deliver. The tone of the film is also ice-cold, and in tandem with its sardonic attitude, could rub some people the wrong way.

Nevertheless, this is a vicious, deeply cynical, deeply sardonic, and deeply ironic dissection of contemporary culture and the forces that drive it. However, finding much to criticise in the millennial pop landscape, Corbet is never nihilistic, mainly because Celeste may have lost her soul, but she is still able to make millions of people happy, even if only transitorily. Both a victim of her time and its desensitised apotheosis, through her, much as he did through Prescott in _Childhood_ of a Leader, Corbet explores questions relating to the interaction between the private and the public. Where are we as a society? What does our obsession with celebrity say about us? What is the cost of fame? Is there any real difference between fame and notoriety? _Vox Lux_ asks such questions, but does not provide answers. That's not Corbet's remit; he merely holds up the looking glass. What we see in it is entirely up to each of us.,","pop star,icon,shooting,1990s,2000s,",67,35,"Brady Corbet,"

I Still See You is about a world which there’s an “event” centered around Chicago (not sure what Hollywood has against that city) in which specters have suddenly become visible, but only for a few minutes, doing routines they did when they were living.

10 years after the “event”, a government program gone awry, the film follows Veronica Calder (BELLA THORNE) whose father had died amongst hundreds, if not thousands, of others. She’s a typical teenager though living in a world where the Federal government has a Spectral Affairs, attending high school. There, she’s captivated by loner Kirk Lane (RICHARD HARMON) whom is considered a truther, believing there is more going on as more and more specters, also known as rems (short of remnants), have begun appearing despite the belief from authorities they would begin fading away as time went on.

There are a rules when it comes to these specters as exposition-ed by history(?) teacher Mr. Bittner (DERMOT MULRONEY): that the rems can’t interact with the living, and rems cannot change a routine or break out of a pattern, amongst a couple others.

In the meantime, Veronica gets a ghostly encounter in the bathroom from a man who she not only has never seen before but he writes a warning on the mirror: “run”, though his name Brian did pop up in her head. She seeks the help from Kirk and he reluctantly agrees to help and soon they put on their Scooby-hats and do research first on how to capture an image of the em and then digging into his past, which is very dark, the suspect behind the strangulations of two teen girls and they discover a connection: both girls were born on February 29, which just happens to be Veronica’s birthday as well. So it would seem Brian, who had committed suicide as the authorities were closing in apparently, is stalking and her life is in danger.

With an interesting premise, I kind of was interested in seeing I Still See You because I’m also a fan of Bella Thorne. While she wasn’t bad, nor was Richard Harmon (better known for his role on The 100), but neither young(ish) actor could overcome such a lame script and an utterly predictable twist that anyone could see coming two miles away once the mystery aspect is set-up (i.e. the murder of the girls at the hands of Brian).

Alright, I’ll outright spoil it right now, so turn away if you don’t want to know.

So, the killer turns out to be Mr. Bittner played by veteran character actor(?) Dermot Mulroney. For his part, Mulroney was okay though be straddled with such a stupid twist, not sure I can blame him too much other than for taking the role (guess beggars can’t be choosers comes to mind) and adding insult to injury, just like we’ll never see a follow up to the Taylor Lautner thriller, Abducted where Mulroney had a cameo at the end to set-up a sequel, I Still See You also sequel-baits. Not sure it will get one unless it finds an audience on home video (the film did manage to get $1M overseas; only $1,359 stateside).

In any case, the film is based upon a novel entitled ‘Break My Heart a 1,000 Times’ by Daniel Waters and a script by Jason Fuchs, the story writer behind Wonder Woman, and was helmed by Scott Speer, the director behind the schmaltzy Midnight Sun (also starring Thorne) and the music-dance-dram, Step Up Revolution.

- Patrick deWitt; _The Sisters Brothers_ (2011)

_The Sisters Brothers_ is a film set in the American Old West, based on a book by a Canadian, made by a mostly French crew, shot primarily in Spain and Romania, featuring a Brit as an American, an American as a Brit, and a British trans comedian as a ruthless American businesswoman. And I don't bring this up out of mere frivolousness; rather, a certain element of schizophrenia is built into the film's very DNA. On the surface it's a Revisionist Western with a gritty Spaghetti aesthetic focusing very much on a group of anti-heroes, but it's also a story of two brothers getting on one another's nerves, a tale of avarice and the destructive potential of progressive thinking, a chase movie, a dark comedy, a tragic fable, an examination of the days when the Old West was giving way to an ever-encroaching modernity, a look at how the sins of the father are oft repeated by the children, a study of competing types of masculinity, and even a political thesis, postulating that there was a time in American history when certain people genuinely believed they could build a harmonious society based on direct democracy and the kind of socialist attitude to capitalism that would make even Bernie Sanders blush.

The English language debut of French director Jacques Audiard, who adapted the script with his regular writing partner Thomas Bidegain from Patrick deWitt's 2011 novel of the same name, the film posits that even those who seem irredeemable may one day find a path to redemption. Very much of a piece with Audiard's more celebrated humanist work such as _De battre mon cœur s'est arrêté_ (2005), _Un prophète_ (2009), and _Dheepan_ (2015), _The Sisters Brothers_ works primarily as a character study about people trying to do what they feel is right in a world arrayed against them. Unfortunately, it did next-to-nothing for me. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, as it clearly has a lot going for it; not the least of which is an unapologetic foregrounding of character over plot. However, its episodic rhythm, bifurcated narrative structure, and poorly-defined morality left me unengaged, frustrated, and rather bored.

1851; the height of the California Gold Rush. In Oregon, Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) and his older brother Eli (John C. Reilly) are hired guns working for ""The Commodore"" (a criminally underused Rutger Hauer). Far more sensitive and thoughtful than his younger brother, Eli is growing weary of the lifestyle, wanting to retire, settle down, and open a grocery store. The more unpredictable and volatile Charlie, however, wants to keep on killing indefinitely. After a mission descends into disarray, Eli is unimpressed when The Commodore appoints Charlie as ""lead man"" for their next quarry; a mild-manner chemist named Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed). Telling Eli that Warm has stolen something from The Commodore which they are to retrieve, Charlie is under orders to keep their real purpose to himself for the time being. Unsure of Warm's exact location, The Commodore has already sent highly-intelligent tracker John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man too gentile for killing, to pick up his trail and detain him until the brothers catch up. Keeping them abreast of his progress via a series of letters, it doesn't take long for Morris to find Warm, telling the brothers he will await them in Jacksonville. However, when Warm learns that The Commodore has sent men after him, he explains to Morris that he has created an elixir that when poured into a river, will illuminate any gold deposits on the river bed, with the only catch being that the potion is extremely caustic, and any sustained exposure results in severe burns. Recognising that Morris is only an advance, he guesses that whoever is still to come is under orders to torture the formula out of him and then kill him. Learning that Warm doesn't want to use the gold for himself, but to help establish ""_an ideal living space, ruled by the laws of true democracy and sharing_"", Morris decides to join him, and they head to San Francisco in an attempt to evade the approaching brothers.

A passion project for star and producer John C. Reilly, who purchased the rights to deWitt's novel shortly after it was published, it was he who first brought the material to Audiard's attention. One of the best-reviewed films at the 2018 Venice Film Festival, where it won Audiard his first Silver Lion for Best Director, when the film went on general release in North America later the same month, it flopped badly, earning only $3 million against a $38 million budget. That's a shame, as Audiard is immensely talented, and although I personally didn't enjoy this particular film, he deserves as much success as he can get. In terms of the novel, I don't know a huge amount about it, but I would imagine Warm's desire to build a Phalanstère in Dallas is inspired by La Réunion, a Fourierist-based utopian community founded in 1855 by Victor Prosper Considerant on the banks of the Trinity River. Wishing to make La Réunion a ""communal experiment administered by a system of direct democracy"", Considerant planned to allow participants to share in profits from capital investments. However, the settlement lasted only 18 months before financial insolvency, shortage of skilled participants, inadequate farming methods, and untenable maintenance costs led to its dissolution.

As one would expect from Audiard, working with his regular editor Juliette Welfling (_Le scaphandre et le papillon_; _The Hunger Games_; _Ocean's 8_) and production designer Michel Barthélémy (_Dobermann_; _Les salauds_; _Frantz_) and for the first time with cinematographer Benoît Debie (_Irréversible_; _Lost River_; _One More Time with Feeling_) and costume designer Milena Canonero (_Barry Lyndon_; _Chariots of Fire_; _The Grand Budapest Hotel_), the film looks amazing. Very much adopting the visual style of a Spaghetti Western, everything on screen looks dirty and/or dusty, whether it's the worn and lived-in costumes, the spartan and uncared for buildings, or even the perpetually unshaven characters and their rotting teeth (an historically accurate detail absent in most modern westerns). Of particular note are the shootouts, of which there are three significant examples. The first takes place at night, and is shot from a distance and without much in the way of coverage; the second is shot primarily from the point of view of two characters doing their best to hide; and the third isn't seen at all - we remain inside as the shooting can be heard on the street.

This should convey, as well as anything, just how revisionist _The Sisters Brothers_ is; the genre's tropes are all there, but they're examined from unexpected angles. A bear attack on a camp is not only not seen, it's not even heard, with our first indication of the incident being when one character wakes up to find another has shot and killed a bear during the night; men are seen riding horses, but when a horse is mortally wounded, the man to whom he belongs cries and apologises; whisky is drunk aplenty, but one character would rather sit alone thinking about home than go whoring or drinking; a film about hired guns ends on a shot of a man sitting in a bath; the anticipated climatic shootout plays out in a manner you'll never see coming. If it does nothing else, the film really drives home that to be able to truly subvert generic tropes, one must first understand and respect how those tropes work.

The film opens with an extraordinarily beautiful and striking scene. It's night on the prairie, which is so dark, we can make out only the barest outline of a house, with a smaller building nearby. After some shouted dialogue, a shootout begins between the house and the smaller building, with each booming gun blast sending out sparks and illuminating for a micro-second the surrounding area. Having vanquished their opponents, the brothers are about to leave the area, when they see a horse, its back covered in flames, galloping away, trying to outrun the fire from which it doesn't understand it can never escape. Realising the barn is on fire, Eli dashes in to try to save the trapped horses, whilst Charlie urges him to remain outside. Is the metaphor of the burning horse a little on the nose? Absolutely; try as they might, the brothers can never escape that which brings them pain, no matter how far or fast they run. But just because it's not exactly subtle doesn't mean it's ineffective, and as opening visual metaphors go, it's as striking an example as you're likely to find. The scene also immediately establishes the differences between Eli (who would risk his own life to save a group of horses) and Charlie (who sees no point in such sacrifices).

In relation to the _milieu_, yes, this is the Old West of John Ford, Anthony Mann, and Sergio Leone, but Audiard defamiliarises it as much as possible. A recurring theme, for example, is that this is a world on the brink of modernity, but whose inhabitants are still very much rooted in the past. This is depicted via a running gag about Eli's fascination with a curious modern invention (the toothbrush; so complicated a device, it comes with an instruction manual), and his childlike glee at staying in a hotel with indoor plumbing. Elsewhere, Morris remarks on how quickly the country is changing, writing, ""_I have travelled through places that didn't exist three months ago. First tents, then houses, then shops, with women fiercely discussing the price of flour._"" Additionally, Warm's progressive egalitarian vision for the future and his desire to use his formula to create a better society for all, allows the film to examine the belief (however short-lived) that out of the lawlessness, land thievery, and Native American genocide, a certain section of the populace hoped a more mutually beneficial society might arise.

However, Audiard, of course, is not naïve enough to suggest that the Old West was especially peaceful or safe; although on the cusp of modernity, this is still a merciless place where violence is a form of currency. But even here, he subverts the genre, using a recurring motif of either Charlie or Eli shooting an already downed opponent pleading for his life, which is certainly not what we've come to expect from the (figurative) white hat protagonists so familiar in Hollywood westerns. Coupled with this, there's the ever-present background of the Gold Rush, and the mercenary mentality it fostered. Indeed, the whole plot is set in motion by The Commodore's greed, and as the film goes on, it comes to focus more and more on the clash between a Darwinian survival of the fittest, might is right mentality (represented by Charlie) and a more esoteric and politically progressive way of thinking (represented by Warm), with Eli and Morris functioning as something of a halfway house between the two extremes.

In terms of acting, Phoenix, Gyllenhaal, and Ahmed all have moments to shine (a monologue in which Morris describes his hatred for his father is especially worth looking out for), but this is Reilly's film through-and-through, turning Eli from a possibly oafish sidekick into an achingly human emotional fulcrum. His nuanced performance allows us to see just how badly Eli's conscience is affecting him, and how much he is drifting away from the increasingly amoral Charlie. Eli has no desire to split with Charlie, but he is slowly coming to the conclusion that he may have no option but to do just that. It's an extraordinarily subtle performance by Reilly, that reminded me a lot of his work in Paul Thomas Anderson's _Magnolia_ (1999), where he played a cop in love with a drug addict who shows unexpected emotional vulnerability, and Rob Marshall's _Chicago_ (2002), in which he played the dim but loyal-to-a-fault husband who emerges as the film's only really moral character. His unexpected affection for his horse is especially poignant, and his tendency to sniff a shawl given to him by his girlfriend is beautifully played by Reilly.

However, for all this, I really disliked the movie, for a myriad of reasons. For one, I found it far too episodic, lurching from one incident to next with little in the way of connective tissue between them. I also didn't particularly like the shifts in focus from the brothers on the one hand to Morris and Warm on the other, with each strand serving only to detract from the other, making it impossible for either to fully settle. A knock-on from this is that the film lacks a strong lead character; although everything suggests that Eli is the protagonist, Phoenix is billed above Reilly, and a lot of the time, Eli seems more like Charlie's sidekick than his equal, making it difficult to figure out where one's empathy is supposed to lie. This difficulty becomes especially problematic in relation to the morally questionable _dénouement_, in which there is an incident which seems designed for the audience to roundly condemn one of the main characters, only for the film to then give us a 15-minute epilogue seemingly designed to redeem him.

This throws into relief what for me was the most egregious problem - none of what we see seems to mean anything, there are virtually no consequences for anything the brothers do (although plenty of consequences for others). This left me scratching my head as to what the film is trying to say. Is it suggesting that even the most morally repugnant of men deserve a shot at redemption? If that is the case, however, its rhetorical position is not especially cogent, as the character mentioned above in no way deserves redemption, allowing his greed and stubbornness to cause untold suffering to others whilst he gets off relatively scot-free. Furthermore, the aforementioned epilogue is hugely anticlimactic, which, I understand, is kind of the point, but it's still a very strange way to wrap things up, feeling forced and emotionally manipulative, completely out of tonal and thematic pace with the rest of the film, and also undermining what could have been a deeply affecting bittersweet final scene. The film is also far too long, and could easily have lost a half hour or more, with the meandering plot becoming interminably boring on more than one occasion.

As a kind of an aside, it's also worth mentioning an aesthetic decision that has me baffled. On occasion, the film is shot within a circular frame (think of how films often simulate POV through a telescope), often combined with racked focus and unsteady photography. I'm assuming the idea is to try to replicate the style of a Kinetograph, but given that device wouldn't be invented for another four decades, I'm not entirely sure what the point is, as the scenes which employ the style don't seem to contain anything to justify the usage. An especially strange example is a scene which sees Charlie speaking direct-to-camera, the only example of such in the whole film. Is this a break in the fourth wall, and if so, why? If it isn't a break, from whose POV is the scene shot? This kind of unjustified visual trickery pulls you right out of the film and offers next-to-nothing in the way of thematic compensation.

The four performances at the heart of _The Sisters Brothers_ earn it a great deal of leeway. But even taking that into account, I just couldn't get into it. Far too plodding and thematically unfocused, although I initially liked the characters a great deal, by the last act, I just wanted it to end already. It's certainly original in how it approaches a number of generic tropes, and that's to be commended, but the imprecise and poorly constructed episodic narrative saps away the goodwill built up by the aesthetic design and the acting. Is it a western? A comedy? A tragedy? An esoteric political piece? A realist depiction of greed trumping idealism? In the end, it doesn't seem to know itself, trying to be many things, and ending up being none of them.,","san francisco, california,based on novel or book,gold,oregon, usa,hitman,male friendship,gold rush,scout,19th century,gold claim,brother brother relationship,",35,67,"Jacques Audiard,"

- Gaspar Noé; ""Gaspar Noé on why his orgiastic Cannes sensation Climax should be shown to kids: 'It's very educational'"" (Kaleem Aftab); _The Telegraph_ (May 15, 2018)

_Climax_, the latest film from Argentinian-French provocateur Gaspar Noé, is a disturbing, depraved, disgusting, and debauched piece of absolute insane genius that I thoroughly adored from beginning to end, and which I never, ever, want to see again.

_Lord of the Flies_ (1954) by way of Heronimus Bosch or Zdzisław Beksiński, _Climax_ is what you might get if you mashed-up Pier Paolo Pasolini's _Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma_ (1975), Darren Aronofsky's _mother!_ (2017), and Anne Fletcher's _Step Up_ (2006); a dance movie that morphs into a horror film, which then attempts to show the audience a literal hell on Earth. In this sense, it's a perfect fit for Noé's oeuvre, focusing as it does on physical disintegration, psychological collapse, and what could be termed ""scorched psyche(s)"". However, considering he is such an infamous figure in world cinema, and considering how honed his overriding thematic preoccupations are, it's strange when you consider that in a career spanning twenty years, Noé has directed only four features prior to _Climax_; _Seul contre tous_ (1998), _Irréversible_ (2002), _Enter the Void_ (2009), and _Love_ (2015). If you've seen any of them, you'll know that his reputation for excess and pushing both his characters and his audiences to the extreme is well earned, and with _Climax_, he takes that audience and those characters further than ever before. Granted, there's nothing here to rival Le Boucher's sickening attack on his pregnant wife from _Seul contre tous_, or the near-unwatchable rape or fire extinguisher scenes from _Irréversible_. However, whereas those films feature sudden moments of barbaric violence punctuating (relatively) quotidian narratives, in _Climax_, the oppressive feeling of dread is unrelenting, affording the audience not even a moment to drop their guard, as not only is there a possibility that something horrific might be around the corner, chances are something definitely is; once everything kicks off, there is simply no reprieve. So even though the acts of violence are not, in themselves, as extreme as some of those in Noé's back-catalogue, the cumulative effect is far worse. Obviously, this makes the film something of an endurance test, even at only 96 minutes, but this is precisely the point – Noé _wants_ the audience to be utterly exhausted by the end, and he employs numerous confrontational and disorientating techniques to achieve such. Disney this most definitely is not.

Set in the winter of 1996, and allegedly based on a real incident in France that year, the film focuses on a dance troupe putting the finishing touches to a performance before embarking on a national tour, to be followed by a series of dates in the US. Apart from the opening shot, and a couple of quick shots towards the end, the entire film is set in the rehearsal space; an isolated and unoccupied hall. Upon finishing rehearsals, the troupe starts to party, with most pairing off to discuss who they've slept with, who they want to sleep with, and who they've unsuccessfully attempted to sleep with, as well as all manner of sexual, drug-related, and hedonistic topics (the conversation about the logistics of anal sex is particularly funny). Although we primarily follow Selva (Sofia Boutella), the group's choreographer, several of the others receive a decent amount of characterisation; the troupe's manager Emmanuelle (Claude Gajan Maull) who has brought her son, Tito (Vince Galliot Cumant), along to rehearsals; Selva's best friend, Lou (Souheila Yacoub), who is hiding a secret from the troupe; self-styled ladies' man and ""_walking invitation to an STD_"" David (Romain Guillermic), who is desperate to sleep with Selva; Daddy (Kiddy Smile), the troupe's DJ; unhappy lesbian couple Psyche (Thea Carla Schøtt) and Ivana (Sharleen Temple); and Gazelle (Giselle Palmer), of whom her brother, Taylor (Taylor Kastle), seems a little overprotective. As the night wears on, it becomes apparent that one of their members has spiked the sangria with powerful LSD. Briefly remaining lucid enough to begin pointing fingers at one another, they round on the one person who wasn't drinking, Omar (Adrien Sissoko), and throw him out into the snow. However, shortly thereafter, the drug kicks in, and each of the troupe descends into their own personal Hades of paranoia, aggression, and/or uninhibited sexuality.

In lieu of any kind of title card or opening credits, _Climax_ begins with an abstract and non-descript shot of pure white. So visually indeterminate is the image (it could literally be anything) that at the screening I attended, most people (myself included) didn't even realise the film had begun. Scored to the disconcerting and otherworldly sounds of Gary Numan's ""Trois Gymnopedies (First Movement)"" (1980), it is only as a girl staggers into shot from the top of the frame that it becomes apparent we are looking directly downwards onto a snowfield. The girl, dressed in a black dress, is in great distress, leaving a trail of blood in her wake. After a moment, she collapses onto the snow, her body convulsing, unable to go any further. The camera then revolves upwards along the vertical-axis through 360°, a shot anyone familiar with Noé's work will immediately recognise. Revealing the bare branches of a few nearby threadbare trees, the movement immediately establishes that we are in an isolated location in the dead of winter. By the time the frame returns to its starting position, the girl's struggles have fashioned a hideously disproportioned and asymmetrical red-tinted snow angel. She struggles for another moment, and then she is still. Theoretically, this could be the clichéd opening scene to any generic slasher movie (the innocent and already injured victim desperately trying to get away from the killer, but too exhausted to continue). However, the striking imagistic composition, the economy with which the shot conveys so much information, and the unusual musical choice, all serve to betray the fact that this is not the work of an anonymous journeyman for hire, but is instead the meticulously composed opening salvo of an auteur who knows precisely what he's doing.

A moment after the girl falls still, the film surprised me for the first (and certainly not the last) time, as the entire closing credits roll (upwards, obviously), right to the copyright information. Initially, I didn't fully understand the point of this. Obviously, the opening shot is, chronologically speaking, pretty late in the narrative, so I was thinking it was just Noé being cute, alerting us to the fact that we'd just seen the closing scene. However, it was only when the film ended that I realised the absolute genius of this aesthetic decision; with no closing credits at the end, the audience is allowed no transition from the film to reality, the buffer that we all take for granted is absent, and the effect is startlingly disorientating. As the film ended, the lights immediately popped on, with no music to play us out, no darkened theatre to recompose ourselves, we're just suddenly back in the garish real world, afforded no opportunity to decompress. Indeed, to enhance the sense of discombobulation for which Noé is obviously striving, the last 15 minutes or so of the film are literally upside-down, with the silhouetted dancers looking like bats hanging from the ceiling (this effect is even extended to an intertitle, which every single person in the theatre tilted their head to try to read). The audience is thus placed in the same position as the characters – the absence of closing credits, and the inverted image create a sense of confusion and discomfort, just as the film is depicting the surviving dancers coming out of their drug-induced mania and back to the real world. As he attempts to do throughout the film, Noé places the audience directly into the psychological reality of the characters. This is extraordinarily proficient filmmaking of the highest calibre.

After the opening scene, the film then cuts to a TV screen showing the dancers' audition interviews. Surrounding the TV are books and films which announce some of _Climax_'s influences, and speak to its genesis. The films include Luis Buñuel's free-associative surrealist masterpiece, _Un Chien Andalou_ (1929); Kenneth Anger's surrealist occult film dealing with the Thelema religion, _The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome_ (1954), which, importantly for Climax, features footage from the hell sequence in Francesco Bertolini, Adolfo Padovan, and Giuseppe De Liguoro's _L'inferno_, a 1911 adaption of the _Inferno_ book from Dante Alighieri's _Divina Commedia_; Masaki Kobatashi's dark samurai film, _Harakiri_ (1962); Dario Argento's dance-hall-based horror film, _Suspiria_ (1977); Lucio Fulci's voodoo/zombie film _Zombi 2_ (1979); Andrzej Żuławski's domestic drama-cum-horror film, _Possession_ (1981); and Rainer Werner Fassbinder's serial killer/LGBT film, _Querelle_ (1982). The books include Franz Kafka's 1915 novella, _Die Verwandlung_, in which a man mysteriously begins to change into an insect; Georges Bataille's 1928 novella _L'histoire de l'oeil_, which charts the increasingly extreme sexual perversions of a young couple; and Pierre Petit's 1992 biography of the homosexual and transvestite painter and photographer Pierre Molinier, _Molinier, une vie d'enfer_. This in-your-face intertextuality at the outset of the film very much sets up the tone of the work to come, alerting the audience as to the style and intentions of the filmmakers. Aside from that, the interviews also do a terrific job of establishing yourself the differing characters, as do the dialogue scenes after the rehearsal but before the LSD has kicked in.

The next scene is the much-talked-about dance number, which is easily the best dance sequence I've ever seen on film. Scored to remixed versions of Cerrone's ""Supernature"" (1977), Patrick Hernandez's ""Born to be Alive"" (1978), and M|A|R|R|S's ""Pump Up the Volume"", the scene is simply breath-taking. Shot in a continuous 20 minute take, the dancers move at extraordinary speeds, with no single position held for more than a second or two. I know very little about dance, so I'm unable to really articulate just how extraordinary and original the scene is. I'm also not even sure as to the style of dancing. Krumping? Waacking? Voguing? An amalgamation of all three? The single-take grants the scene a sense of real-time immediacy and in-camera verisimilitude which one can usually only acquire from a live performance – this isn't something constructed by an editor from a series of individual takes, this is something literally happening before our eyes, no cheating, no effects, simply a group of insanely talented and utterly mesmerising performers. Put it this way, the dancing is so impressive, if I hadn't known it was being performed by professional dancers, I would be convinced some of it was CGI. Indeed, although it's shot in one take, the camera is anything but stationary, moving back and forth, and oftentimes directly above the dancers. In this sense, the viewer is not only watching the dance, they are, in effect, participants. Speaking to _The Telegraph_, Noé states,

> _I wanted the camera to feel like another dancer. We saw the joy of the dancers moving and I wanted to replicate that with the camera moves._

Again, he is working to transpose the audience into the world of the film – he doesn't simply show us a dance sequence, he tries to include us in it.

Thus ends the first section of the film. The second, and much shorter, section is the dancers engaged in conversation with one another (and, in contrast to the first section, is made up of a multitude of edits eschewing any sense of match-cutting). The third, and longest, section sees Selva realise the sangria is spiked, the troupe attempt to find out who did it, and the chaos that ensues when the drugs take hold. These three sections (dance, conversations, and drugs) roughly correspond to the three books of the _Divina Commedia_ - _Paradiso_, _Purgatorio_, and _Inferno_. However, in the poem, the order is _Inferno_, _Purgatorio_, and _Paradiso_, charting the ascension of the soul from the Inferno of Hades to the Paradiso of spiritual unification with God and Christ in heaven. In the film, the movement is in the opposite direction, as the Paradiso of the harmonious and unified perfection in the dance sequence gives way to the calm Purgatorio after the consumption of the LSD, but before it has taken over their reason. Finally, they descend to the Inferno – the dance-hall becomes a deadly battleground, a hell on Earth, bathed in deep reds and greens, as the entire troupe are overtaken by psychic torment, manifested as physical destruction, with the body itself both the implement of ruination and the primary victim.

In charting this allegorical journey, one of the most immediately interesting things is the obvious visual contrast to the dance sequence. Whilst the dance sees the group acting in unison, all of a single mind, the third section of the film shows them fragmented and in disarray, each individual driving towards their own purpose, whether it be paranoia, hedonism, or what they believe they need to do to survive. The harmony of the troupe has given way to the horror of individualised disintegration and psychological collapse. This reminded me a little of the fall of Lear, sinking from grandiose threats such as ""_Come not between the dragon and his wrath_"" (I.i.130) and ""_The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft_"" (I.i.152), to his pathetic ""_I am a man more sinned against than sinning_"" (III.ii.49) and ""_I am a very foolish, fond old man_"" (IV.vii.60) - in the context of the film, the fall from the height of the dance to the bestial nature of the third section is no less epic.

Something that bridges the two sections, however, is the music, which literally never stops once the film begins. Consisting of a mixture of '80s and '90s electronica and anachronistic early 21st century techno, as the film progresses, and in keeping with the descent into hell, the softer sounds of the dance sequence give way to more intense pieces such as Suburban Knights' ""The Worlds"" (1990), Dopplereffekt's ""Superior Race"" (1995), and Aphex Twin's ""Windowlicker"" (1999), whilst the film closes, bizarrely, with a remix of The Rolling Stones' ""Angie"" (1973).

Perhaps the most noticeable similarity between the dance sequence and the third section of the film is that both are shot in single-takes. The drug sequence lasts 42 minutes, and is presented as one continuous shot of the world collapsing in front of the characters' eyes - although in reality, it is several long takes where the edits have been disguised, à la _Birdman: or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)_. Following first one character before trading off to someone with whom they have interacted, director of photography Benoît Debie's (_The Runaways_; _Spring Breakers_; _Lost River_) camera moves almost ballet-like throughout the space, sweeping in and around the characters as they fall apart. The lack of any editing, as with the dance sequence, enhances the immediacy of the image, heightening the sense of paranoia from which the entire group are now suffering, and leaving the audience as exposed as the characters themselves.

As the rehearsal space turns into a nightmarish landscape comparable with Hans Memling's, ""The Last Judgement"" (1467-1471), Pieter Bruegel the Elder's ""The Triumph of Death"" (c.1562) and ""Dull Gret"" (1593), Peter Paul Rubens's ""Massacre of the Innocents"" (1636-1638), or Francisco Goya's ""Saturn Devouring His Son"" (1819-1823), the film treats us to a girl's head being set on fire, a pregnant girl being kicked repeatedly in the stomach, a girl slashing her own arm and face, a contortionist contorting to the point where he literally splinters his own bones, a child locked in a room full of cockroaches, a man scratching his chest to the point that it turns into four red bloody streaks, public urination, lesbian rape, incest, and suicide. The troupe descend into a kind of deeply twisted and barbaric gang-mentality, what we might expect if _Lord of the Flies_ had been written by the Marquis de Sade, urging one another on to acts of unimaginable and ever-increasing violence and degradation. As the veneer of civilisation is stripped away, the characters devolve before our eyes; some become concerned only with sex, others with violence, whilst a small few try to help their fellow sufferers, although even they ultimately give in to their basest instincts. Indeed, Noé tells _The Telegraph_,

> _it's like the start of 2001, we see the apes and then they evolve into humans, and in the case of my film it is like the humans go back to being apes. Humans are going back to their original forces […] LSD or mainly alcohol can bring you back to a more reptilian way of thinking, you are not human anymore. It is all about survival, about reproducing species, about sex and domination. The moment we start losing control of the logical brain we go to a psychotic way of thinking._

But what is it all about? Is there any kind of theme underpinning the whole thing, in the same way that _Salò_ isn't really about forcing young girls to eat faeces or cutting off boy's tongues, it is actually about (amongst other things) political corruption, the abuse of power, fascism, and economic inequality. It would certainly be easy to dismiss _Climax_ as thematically empty, arguing that the brilliant camerawork and pumping soundtrack serve only to cover up the vapidity at its core, to argue that the depravity and excess is not in the service of any grand universal point or allegorical thinking, but simply to show attractive young people tearing one another apart. Even if one buys into Noé's devolution argument, the idea that the film presents ""man as beast"", it still doesn't offer thematic relevance. So, in a nutshell, is _Climax_ shocking for the sake of being shocking?

Not exactly.

Yes, this is exhibitionist cinema through and through, the type of film that dares you to look at it intently until you can't look anymore, as if the filmmaker is standing behind you saying, ""I knew you'd look away."" But there is definitely more to it than that. For example, there is some kind of political point buried beneath the carnage and broken bodies; the dance sequence takes place in front of a massive French flag, whilst the credits declare, ""_A French Film. And proud of it_."" Perhaps related to this, the troupe is made up of a cross-section of Europeans – gay, straight, men, women, transsexual, black, white, eastern, western. In the explosion of excess hedonism and hysterical mayhem, does this cross-section of ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations come to represent European multiculturalism tearing itself apart? Is Noé saying that if France continues to accommodate such a diversity of disparate cultures, chaos will ensue? Possibly. In this sense, the early parts of the film would represent the liberal ideal of perfect multicultural harmony, whilst the later section is a conservative's wet dream, showing what could happen in such a melting pot. The dance sequence thus represents a politically harmonious multicultural society composed of a barrage of norms and peoples, all working together for the greater good. In relation to this, perhaps tellingly, Omar, the person who is initially blamed for spiking the sangria, is Muslim (which is how everyone immediately knows he wasn't drinking). Is this merely a plot point, or is it part of the larger allegorical canvas?

To flip this argument, is Noé saying that in such a multicultural _milieu_, with fear of Islam at a high, it's very easy to blame everything on the Islamic ""Other"". Additionally, Noé depicts that dance scene with such reverence and awe that this kind of social critique, barely straddling the line between patriotism and xenophobia, doesn't seem to sit especially comfortably. Not to mention that Noé himself is an immigrant – he was born in Argentina, moving to France when he was 13. Maybe he's simply criticising the hedonistic youth of today, and their love of excess. However, whilst the political allegory might be reading too much into the film, suggesting the whole thing is simply so Noé can proclaim ""kids today"" is reducing it all to a far too simplistic degree. He is no Pier Paolo Pasolini, but neither is he a curmudgeonly old man!

The fact is, I don't have a clue what _Climax_ is about. Nor do I care. Nor is it important. I would argue instead that if you spend the duration of the film trying to figure out what it's all about, then you have missed what it's all about. You can only see the film for the first time once, and it's better to let it carry you into the nether-regions rather than trying to analyse it. With that in mind, I take it for what it appears on the surface; an incredibly technically proficient depiction of a contemporary Inferno, as aesthetically impressive as it is morally questionable, as enthralling as it is disturbing, and as evocative as it is shocking, a film of unparalleled barbarism, that also stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic achievements in recent years.

It's a work of genius. Twisted, sick, deraved genius, but genius nonetheless. It disturbed me like no film in at least a decade, and I couldn't get it out of my head for days afterwards. I absolutely loved every single crazy minute of it. And I don't ever wish to see it again. For Noé, I can think of no higher compliment.,","desperation,dance,paranoia,pregnancy,lsd,long take,urination,violence,lgbt,spiked drink,punch bowl,",24,28,"Gaspar Noé,"

_Boy Erased_ is one of those films it seems almost churlish to criticise for its formal aspects, given that it obviously comes from a place of deep respect, has genuinely laudable intentions (albeit with one eye on award season), and says something undeniably important and just. Written and directed by Joel Edgerton (who also stars and produces), the film is based on Garrard Conley's _Boy Erased: A Memoir of Identity, Faith, and Family_ (2016), the true story of his experiences with conversation therapy in Arkansas in 2004. In a political climate where progressive thinking seems to be backsliding more and more, given the regressive beliefs of many of those in power, one should celebrate a film which highlights the barbaric concept of enforcing heteronormative social mores by way of psychological, and often physical, abuse. However, simply because a film has good intentions, it doesn't necessarily follow that it's a good film, and _Boy Erased_ is such an example; a film whose aims can be praised, but whose flaws cannot be ignored. Whereas Desiree Akhavan's recent _The Miseducation of Cameron Post_ approached similar subject matter from a perspective of irreverence and satire, _Boy Erased_ is far more sincere. And because of its self-seriousness and its insistence on keeping the audience emotionally distanced from the characters, it remains underwhelming, never getting anywhere near the kind of emotional highs and lows one might anticipate from such inherently sensitive material. It's a topical and morally laudable film, unquestionably. One wishes it were simply better than it is.

Set in 2004, the film begins as 19-year-old Jared Eamons (Lucas Hedges) attends his first day at Love in Action, a conversion therapy program in Arkansas. The son of Southern Baptist preacher and car salesman Marshall (Russell Crowe) and his wife Nancy (Nicole Kidman), Jared is initially looking forward to the program, keen to be purged of his homosexual impulses. Run by Victor Sykes (Edgerton), the program is based on the concept that homosexuality is a choice influenced by poor parenting and moral abnormalities in a person's extended family, and thus Sykes has students draw a family tree indicating such things as drug or alcohol addiction, use of pornography, criminal convictions etc. Students must also sign a waiver declaring that they won't speak with anyone about what occurs during therapy. Other students include Jon (Xavier Dolan), who is so fanatically devoted to conversion, he refuses to even touch other men, although he turns up every day with fresh bruises; Gary (Troye Sivan), who has made peace with his homosexuality, and plans to pretend to be straight until he can leave; and Cameron (Britton Sear), a timid aspiring footballer. Meanwhile, Nancy rents a nearby motel room where she and Jared will stay for the duration of the program. However, Jared soon learns from Jon and Gary that there is no specific end-point for the therapy, and if he fails to convince Sykes that he is straight, he may be required to move onto the campus full-time. The backstory of how he came to be signed up to the program then unfolds achronologically, intercutting his increasingly unsettling time at Love in Action with such incidents as his awkward first sexual encounter with his ex-girlfriend, Chloe (Madelyn Cline); his first homosexual experience at college, with his running-partner, Henry (Joe Alwyn); a non-sexual relationship with a fellow college student, Xavier (Théodore Pellerin); how his parents found out about his homosexuality; and Marshall's decision, taken in consultation with two church elders, to send Jared to therapy.

I'm a heterosexual male from a country where conversion therapy isn't really a thing; there is only one conversion therapy program in Ireland, and, as of January 2019, a bill to outlaw such therapy is passing through the Oireachtas. Given my very limited exposure to the subject, I was more than a little surprised to learn that in the US, only 15 states (plus Washington, DC) have legislated against the practice, and in the remaining 35, it's perfectly legal. To be honest, I can't even get my head around the fact that some people won't accept homosexuality amongst their family or friends, so the concept of parents knowingly exposing their children to psychological abuse so as to ""pray away the gay"", and doing so within the scope of the law, is completely beyond the realm of comprehension. That such things still happen in a modern so-called civilised western society is both deeply disturbing and incredibly upsetting, and it is this world into which _Boy Erased_ offers a window.

Once Jared is installed at Love in Action, it isn't long before Sykes begins to preach ""_you cannot be born homosexual. It's a choice_"" and ""_God will not love you the way that you are_"". At the same time, the students are tutored in ""_masculine_"" physicality (don't cross your legs when seated, don't slouch, always shake hands firmly), discouraged from anything that deviates from heteronormative behaviour (Jared has pages from a notebook of short stories torn out and discarded), and advised on what not to read (when Sykes learns Jared's college course includes such titles as Oscar Wilde's _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ (1890) and Vladimir Nabokov's _Lolita_ (1955), he suggests that Jared shouldn't return to his studies, committing instead to Love in Action full-time).

However, the film is not confined to the program, also offering an examination of some of the attitudes of fundamentalist religiosity toward sexuality. Significantly, when Marshall learns that Jared is planning on spending the night with Chloe, he is quite proud of his son, although both Marshall and Nancy already assume that Jared and Chloe will be getting married in the not-too-distant future. Although the film admirably resists the urge to vilify Marshall or Nancy, even Love in Action itself, Edgerton is unequivocal in condemning a system that compartmentalises anything with which it disagrees as ""_taboo_"", thereby retarding any kind of discussion. Love in Action is predicated on making young people feel guilty regarding the ""sin"" of their sexual practices and/or impulses, whilst at the same time reinforcing the infallibility of church doctrine. This instils a deep-rooted sense of torment for young men and women who are already confused about what they are feeling - if a person's predilections are directly in contradistinction to church dogma, then such predilections must obviously be immoral and against God; the irreconcilability of innate homosexual desire with the fact that such homosexuality is a sin.

The film opens with voiceover narration over home video footage of Jared as a baby, immediately setting him up as the focal character, and inculcating us into his world. Indeed, Jared appears in every scene, although, strangely, voiceover is never employed again, rendering this initial use stylistically isolated. Visually, the film is drab and unimaginative, but deliberately so. This blandness may initially seem disappointing, given that Edgerton's 2015 directorial debut, _The Gift_, was visually impressive. However, in _Boy Erased_ the design is intended to mirror the interior of Love in Action - a place of functionality over aesthetic nuance, a place where neutralising colours are used to enforce reserve and restraint at the expense of vitality. If anything, Edgerton is too successful with this mirroring, as the insipidness of the Love in Action scenes often bleeds into the scenes outside the program. Had Edgerton, cinematographer Eduard Grau (_A Single Man_; _Buried_; _Suite Française_), and production designer Chad Keith (_Take Shelter_; _Midnight Special_; _Leave No Trace_) showed a little more _panache_ when depicting the outside world, such scenes would have been far more thematically impactful, as their visual differentiation would have served the central tenets of the film.

In terms of the acting, as Jared, Lucas Hedges has a difficult task, playing a character that becomes increasingly withdrawn and emotionally shut down as the film progresses. From the very beginning, Jared is somewhat distant, making it difficult to determine if his muted emotions are part of Hedges's performance or a weakness in that performance. For example, is his inherent lack of fear a component of the character, or is Hedges simply not tapping into the necessary emotions? That this might be the case can be seen if one compares his performance to that of Xavier Dolan as Jon, who exudes desperation and existential panic every second he's on screen. Of course, Jared is very much a passive character, with only one notable example of him asserting his own agency and breaking through the emotional paralysis which has stifled the character (and the actor). When this scene does come, it's quite powerful, with Hedges playing it in such a way as to suggest the release of long-gestating pressure. On the other hand, in a scene where he screams and throws rocks at a glass-encased picture of a male model, the performance comes across as a performance and doesn't ring emotionally true. As a whole, I felt that Hedges played Jared pretty much identically to how he played Patrick in Kenneth Lonergan's _Manchester by the Sea_ (2016).

Kidman plays Nancy as a woman who very much subscribes to the notion that the man is the head of the household, accepting Marshall's decision to send Jared to therapy without openly questioning him. However, it's obvious from the start that she's not entirely comfortable. Later, as she starts to learn some of what is going on behind the closed doors of Love in Action, her attitude becomes more and more adversarial. She has a particularly good scene where she finally persuades Jared to allow her to read Love in Action's manifesto, and is equal parts shocked by the content and amused by the spelling mistakes (she finds one particular reference to ""_Almighty Dog_"" especially funny and especially worrying). Kidman plays the scene with a mixture of horror, amusement, and a desire to step in and protect her child, and she modulates these conflicting emotions perfectly.

As for Marshall, instead of him being the token villain of the piece, Crowe plays him as fundamentally conflicted. He loves his son deeply and is devastated by what has happened, so he never goes the clichéd route of condemning him from the pulpit and casting him into eternal hellfire. Marshall genuinely wants to help Jared, and even more so, he wants to understand, but is prevented from doing so by a lifetime of faith and his absolute conviction of his own moral certitude. Despite the character's flaws, Crowe's quiet and restrained performance elicits a degree of sympathy for a man who is clearly out of his depth, unable to overcome the indoctrination which is now making a relationship with his son an impossibility. As Sykes, Edgerton gives an almost robotic performance, playing the character as a regimental fundamentalist. A man without any peripheral vision in terms of morality and devotion to God, he is the kind of person who not only refuses to accept opinions that are in contradistinction to his own, but who is unable to even get his head around the fact that such opinions exist at all.

However, despite the strong performances from both Kidman and Crowe, the film fails to depict the texture and nuances of the family dynamic. All three family members are, to a certain extent, types rather than fully fleshed out individuals. Along the same lines, none of the Love in Action students are granted any kind of arc or personality beyond that of the archetype they represent. Jon, Gary, and Cameron are all sketches of characters we've seen time and again in this kind of pseudo-prison narrative, and the film often falls back on generic tropes - hypocritical authority figures; a sadistic authority figure who is abusive beyond the parameters of the program (played by Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers); the ""inmate"" on the verge of complete psychological breakdown (think Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) from Stanley Kubrick's _Full Metal Jacket_); the focal character resisting the mandates of the institution (think McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) in Miloš Forman's _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ or Dufresne (Tim Robbins) in Frank Darabont's _The Shawshank Redemption_). Regarding Sykes, a postscript describing his own sexual preference casts his character in a completely different light, and would have made for fascinating material had it been incorporated into the narrative. Granted, this is Jared's story, not Sykes's, but that doesn't change the fact that more information on his background (especially given what the postscript reveals) would have been very welcome.

It's also somewhat problematic that the only homosexual sexual activity depicted in the film is a rape. It's a powerful scene in and of itself, brilliantly shot in a single static take which forces the viewer to watch what is happening unmediated by editing or blocking. However, it's unsettling that Edgerton never shows us any consensual and pleasurable homosexual content. True, the film is not about sexual activity, so to only show one scene of such activity is fair enough in theory. But it remains problematic that the only time we see a homosexual character acting on their impulses is a rape scene. What is one supposed to take from that? Presumably, the scene is supposed to balance against the scene where Jared spends the night with Xavier without becoming physical. However, this scene is given far less time than the rape, and the character who rapes Jared is given far more characterisation than Xavier, creating a noticeable imbalance.

Another problem is that, as a whole, it's an extremely cold film, remaining always distanced, either unwilling or unable to really get into the fear and psychological trauma inflicted upon the attendees of programs such as Love in Action. Perhaps Edgerton was trying to avoid exploitative or manipulative emotion, but whatever the case, he has made a film that is itself emotionless, undercutting the harrowing story it tells by always keeping the audience one or two steps removed. Jared, in particular, is never depicted with anything resembling emotional specificity. We never feel his torment or loneliness, with his character depicted only to the extent necessary to drive the plot, and far too distanced for him to emotionally impact the audience.

_Boy Erased_ is a laudable film dealing with an important subject, but it's also quite a poor film, with a disjointed narrative and paper-thin characters, redeemed only by fine performances from Kidman and Crowe. The biggest problem is that it insists on pushing the audience away, presenting the story clinically rather than emotionally, a dispassionate reportage rather than an angry denunciation. Edgerton's even-handedness is to be commended, as is his refusal to cast the parents, or even Love in Action itself, as the villains, and his avoidance of emotional manipulation is praiseworthy up to a point. However, there comes a moment in the film where you realise that you're as close to these characters as you're going to get, yet they have still only been summarised. The film will probably go on to be an important document in the ongoing attempt to eradicate this cruel practice. It will probably open the eyes of a lot of people who didn't know much about this subject. It is well-intentioned, and comes from a place of compassion and respect. It's just not an especially good film.,","homophobia,based on a true story,coming of age,religion,based on memoir or autobiography,lgbt,lgbt teen,college student,dread,conversion therapy,lgbt interest,",32,23,"Joel Edgerton,"

I don't think this movie is as bad nor as good as some of the reviews I read before watching it. One negative for me is how many large themes and issues the writing takes on with its complex plot, but conversely, one of its strengths is all of the large themes and issues the movie tackles. In other words, when it works, it really works.

There are a lot of sympathetic characters in this saga, and even the few less sympathetic ones are given depth and the opportunity for personal growth during the course of the movie. It seems like interesting choices were made when to translate the Spanish dialogue and when not to, but I don't feel I missed out on important stuff.

The ""feel"" of the movie reminds me a lot of ""Booksmart"", but almost more ""versus"" than ""cooperative"", if that makes sense to you.

I'm a big fan of Hannah Marks, and less so of Liana Liberato, and while the focus is typically on April, it really felt like they should have been cast in each others's roles, and it's not like Liberato can't carry a lead role.  The roles just didn't feel intuitive, and the movie does one of those things where I feel like it's trying to tell me who's hotter, and (for me) Hannah Marks makes more sense as the ""hot new thing"", and she's the stronger personality.  But that's probably why she has the lead here.

It was also frustrating to watch the characters do ""stupid high schoolers with too many options"" mistakes over and over, letting such a jerk control any level of validation in their lives, and I suppose that's the point that I'm missing is how to relate to it as a young woman that can't control what her wants are, even if they are bad for her.

I have similar stupid things I did when I was younger as a guy, and I think that's what frustrated me.  The point in saying any of that is that that ""frustration"" is what takes this movie from potentially great to a more average viewing experience.

While it's a fine movie, with good characters, acting, and writing, it doesn't feel uplifting or hopeful, the ""intensity in battle"" is social in nature and not what I'm looking for in a movie, but that doesn't mean that others won't like this much more than me.,",,10,5,"Benjamin Kasulke,"

Everything is entertainment, whether it's shame, invasion of privacy, abuse, no matter what it is it's become almost a sporting event. It's like the new Roman Coliseum in a way.

- Sam Levinson; ""Sam Levinson on Creating Chaos in _Assassination Nation_""; filmschoolrejects.com (September 26, 2018)

Centred around a quartet of unapologetically (or perhaps unknowingly) shallow teen girls more concerned with getting likes on Instagram than decent grades, and culminating in an orgy of gender-demarcated violence, _Assassination Nation_ is one of those films that seems to set out to try to offend everyone – from the social justice warriors on the left to the second amendment fetishisers on the right, from Millennial snowflakes who have never known life without social media to Baby boomers who just can't get their head around why going viral is so important. And pretty much everyone in between. The satirical ire of writer/director Sam Levinson's (son of Barry Levinson) second feature, however, is aimed more specifically at those who tend to see the proclivities of sexually ""aggressive"" (i.e., sexually confident) young women through misogyny-tinted glasses as the ruination of society (the type of insecure males who believe the term ""toxic masculinity"" is an oxymoron). Presumably inspired by the ""Sukeban"" [boss girl] phenomenon in Japan during the 70s and 80s, the film essentially depicts what might have happened if both the accused and the accusers during the Salem witch trials had had access to social media and assault rifles. Starting out as a hilarious, if disturbing, commentary on a society becoming ever more defined by online hysteria and the erosion of traditional concepts of privacy, the film charts a course from Michael Lehmann's _Heathers_ (1988) and Mark Waters's _Mean Girls_ (2004) to James DeMonaco's _The Purge_ (2013) by way of Joe Dante's _The Second Civil War_ (1997), Michael Mann's _Blackhat_ (2015), and Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott's _Bushwick_ (2017). True, it does run out of steam in its third act, and, overall, it tries to take on too many issues, with several themes (and plotlines) disappointingly glossed over. Nevertheless, this is perceptive stuff, with a solid central socio-political thesis, a savagely satirical narrative (even if it is populated by underwritten characters), and a vivid depiction of high-school teenagers pushed beyond all reason.

Set in a town called Salem in an undesignated state (it is NOT supposed to be Salem, Massachusetts, as so many reviews have claimed), Lily Colson (Odessa Young) is a fairly typical 18-year-old high-school senior. Intelligent, creative, and obsessed with her social media presence, Lily is part of a tightly-knit clique of four girls, along with Bex (Hari Nef), Em (Abra), and Sarah (Suki Waterhouse). Although Lily is ostensibly dating Mark (Bill Skarsgård), unbeknownst to her friends, she is also involved in a sexting relationship with an older man, identified as ""Daddy"". Life is relatively normal until an unknown hacker named Er0str4tus (after Herostratus, who torched the Temple of Artemis so as to become famous) releases private footage of the ultra-conservative, anti-homosexual Major Bartlett (Cullen Moss) interacting with male escorts and wearing women's lingerie. Several days later, the phone of Principal Turrell (Colman Domingo) is also hacked, and non-sexual naked pictures of his six-year-old daughter are sent across the town, with people accusing him of being a paedophile. As the police and the FBI investigate the hacks, a massive data dump of half the people in Salem is posted online, including the pictures and sexts Lily had been sending to ""Daddy"". With the town turning on itself, as friends and family members find their private messages about one another exposed for all to see, the four girls find themselves at the dangerous centre of a rapidly escalating situation.

_Assassination Nation_ made news in January 2018, when it was the biggest sale at the Sundance Film Festival, purchased by NEON for $10 million. However, when it went on wide release in North America in September, it flopped badly, taking only $1 million in its opening weekend, and finishing 15th at the box office. Even for a modestly budgeted film, that's a horrendous opening, and for a film showing in over 1,400 theatres to not even break the top ten is virtually unheard of. Indeed, it had the worst wide release opening weekend of the year, earning just $733 per theatre. This is a real shame, but perhaps it's not unexpected. The film has ""cult status"" written all over it, and the fact that it holds a very unflattering mirror up to contemporary American society was never exactly going to pull in the multiplex crowds, irrespective of festival buzz and reasonably positive reviews. That that mirror is satirical probably didn't help either. 31% of Americans believe that a second Civil War will happen within their lifetime, almost certainly race related, and I can't imagine people who think this way being especially receptive to the kind of satire seen in this film.

_Assassination Nation_ works primarily, if not wholly, by way of exaggeration, as with so much great Juvenalian satire – from the writings of Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis himself to Jonathan Swift's mastering of the form in works such as ""A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, And For making them Beneficial to the Publick"" (1729) to modern novels such as Tom Wolfe's _The Bonfire of the Vanities_ (1987) and Bret Easton Ellis's _American Psycho_ (1991), onto films such as Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ (1994) and Barry Levinson's _Wag the Dog_ (1997). The _milieu_ of the film is not such as would be found in a piece of social realism, nor does it claim to be. Instead, it works to draw attention to various cultural aspects by way of hyperbole, embellishment, and outlandish exaggeration. Nowhere is this clearer than the film's very premise – all Er0str4tus has to do to destabilise Salem is let everyone know what everyone else is thinking. Obviously, Levinson is not positing this as a real-world scenario; instead, he is accentuating the damage such a thing could do to highlight our society's very real obsession with social media and the concomitant importance of digital privacy.

Possible to either deride the film as the worst imaginable type of excess of #MeToo, or celebrate it as an insightful examination of the origins of a fempowerment created by those very forces which led to #MeToo in the first place, you know you're situated firmly in outrage culture when you hear characters refer to the LGBTQ community as the LGBTQQIAAP community. Taking as its starting point the fear that female agency (particularly regarding sexuality) can instil in the patriarchal status quo, the film then hypothesises what might happen if that fear is pushed to the extreme as men try to reassert their dominance, given the current political climate in the US. The film presents a patriarchy which firmly believes that if young women dress provocatively, they must be sluts, and thus they have it coming, whatever ""it"" may be. In this sense, Levinson addresses how previously frowned-upon right-wing and/or misogynist views have gained a degree of social acceptability and mainstream visibility during Donald Trump's presidency, and although Trump is never mentioned by name, there are several allusions to him. For example, towards the end of the film, an armed militia group are shown wearing red #MAGA-style baseball hats, whilst Richter (Jeff Pope), a local policeman, calls the group ""_good people_,"" itself a trigger phrase in light of Trump's use of it to describe the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.

However, the film is cognisant enough to acknowledge that racial disharmony, sexism, and toxic masculinity were not invented by Trump, positing instead that such views have long been a part of the American anthropological character, with Trump simply exacerbating and, in terms of far-right hate groups, legitimising such thinking. This has led to an American society more sharply demarcated along partisan lines than perhaps at any time since the Civil War, certainly any time since Vietnam. Speaking to Seventh Row, Suki Waterhouse states,

> _right now, in America at least, we're in this sort of stand-off. And standoffs don't normally end well._

_Assassination Nation_ is, in part, about what happens when this stand-off erupts.

Levinson sets the tone immediately. The opening shot shows a camera moving along a suburban street, passing by idyllic white picket fences, _Blue Velvet_-style, with people performing mundane tasks such as emptying the trash and watering the lawn. Except everyone is wearing a mask of some kind. A voice-over then informs us that this is a story about how Salem ""_lost its motherfucking mind_."" The audience is then warned that there are things in the upcoming film some may find objectionable, and a rapidly edited montage shows a series of quick clips, each one labelled with a requisite ""trigger warning"" – drug use, sexual content, toxic masculinity, homophobia, transphobia, guns, nationalism, racism, kidnapping, the male gaze, sexism, swearing, torture, violence, gore, weapons, and fragile male egos. This abrasive, confrontational, self-reflexive style continues for much of the film, which is purposely designed to confront, provoke, and challenge people, not only thematically, but aesthetically.

One particularly good example of this concerns the aforementioned male gaze. An early shot shows the four girls walking into school in slow motion as the camera starts at their feet and slowly pans up their bare legs before moving around behind them. You couldn't get a more textbook example of a cinematic male gaze. So is Levinson being hypocritical, reproducing what he claims to be condemning? Not at all. Towards the end of the film, the exact same shot is repeated, but in this instance, the girls are effectively going to war, and the male gaze is no longer an issue, something the film draws to the audience's attention by replicating the form of the earlier shot – in short, the male gaze is reproduced so as to later satirise and ridicule it. That a number of professional critics have completely missed this is staggering to me, although none go to quite such ridiculous extremes as the _Los Angeles Times_' Katie Walsh, who accuses Levinson and cinematographer Marcell Rév (_Fehér Isten_; _Jupiter holdja_; _Paterno_) of taking ""_much delight in wringing every sexy moment out of attacking young women_."" Which is precisely what the film doesn't do. In fact, it's literally the opposite of what the film does, a misreading which reminds me of critics who accused David Fincher's _Fight Club_ (1999) of endorsing fascism.

Aesthetically, the data dump and its effects are also well-rendered. For example, when Er0str4tus is first seen clicking send, his click is accompanied by the non-diegetic sound of an explosion. Later, after the data dump, but prior to people turning on one another, learning that her best friend has been mocking her behind her back, an acquaintance of the central quartet takes a baseball bat, finds her friend in the school gym, and cracks her over the head. This scene is the point of no return, the first act of violence from which all others will follow. The scene starts out normal enough, but soon the camera turns upside-down and we see the girl standing against an unrealistically large American flag. Turning the camera upside-down like this mid-shot and using the flag in this way indicates that something within the social fabric has fundamentally changed; there has been some kind of paradigm shift. Indeed, speaking of the American flag, it's a recurring motif throughout the film, but we rarely see it without a gun nearby, usually in the same shot. Make of that what you will. Another aesthetically interesting scene is early in the film when the screen in split into three whilst the girls are at a party, one pane following Lily, one following Bex, and one following Em and Sarah. This has the effect of cutting the girls off from one another, isolating them in a Snap Chat shaped panel, and suggesting that even here, when they seem at their most confident, they are performing, aware of being watched. Text message chains and phone-quality videos are also used throughout the film, enhancing this erosion of any sense of privacy.

The film's most aesthetically accomplished scene, however, is a five-minute single-take shot depicting a home invasion, with the camera remaining outside the house, following the action as it moves from window to window. It's a dazzling sequence that has the effect of positioning the audience as passive spectators. Shot on a dolly rig housing a technocrane with a 42-foot arm that moves from the second floor to the first and back again, the scene came about because Levinson was trying to find ""_the scariest way possible_"" to stage the scene. Designed to depict an event that ""_was continually in motion_,"" Levinson tells the _New York Times_,

> _there was something very apropos about watching this horror unfold, and being helpless in relation to it._

This, of course, is one of the film's main themes – the idea of passively and emotionlessly watching videos of tragedies online.

Speaking of themes, one of the film's strengths, but also one of its weaknesses, is the sheer volume of issues with which it engages; misogyny, feminism, fempowerment, social media, sexual assault, #MeToo, bullying, gun culture, toxic masculinity, the male gaze, racism, gang mentality, digital privacy, desensitisation, mansplaining. In only the third scene, shocked at Lily's drawings of naked women in sexually provocative positions, Turrell tells her, ""_this is high-school, and justly or unjustly, there are limits to what you can say_,"" as she tries to argue that nudity does not necessarily have to be sexual. Adopting a feminist defence, she posits that her art is reflective of how difficult it is for women in a misogynistic selfie-obsessed social media-saturated culture, explaining,

> _it's not about the nudity. It's about the thousands of naked selfies you took to get just one right._

Something which men (generally) don't have to worry about.

Arising from this are a plethora of other issues, some vital to the story Levinson is telling, some not so much. For example, firmly of the belief that privacy is a thing of the past, Lily claims that her generation accepts that their lives are for mass consumption, and all they can do are try to choose how they are consumed. But even that choice isn't a given. In relation to this, the film addresses the myriad ways that young girls are represented on social media, deconstructing and satirising the inherently misogynistic assumptions that underpin so many of our attitudes to online behaviour (if a guy shows off his washboard abs, it's no big deal, but if a woman shows off her cleavage, we must call the elders!!). Indeed, the hypocrisy and ""holier-than-thou"" attitudes most people assume online, afforded such by the relative anonymity, come to the fore when naked pictures of Turrell's six-year-old daughter in a bath are leaked, and the town accuse him of being a paedophile. However, as Lily points out to her parents, there's a naked baby photo of her hanging in their house, so why is that not considered pornographic?

The film also asks the question of why a woman, generally speaking, cannot dress provocatively without being labelled (by some) a slut, all-but asking to be sexually assaulted. Victim shaming is an especially hot topic here in Ireland at the moment because of a recent case in which the lawyer for a man accused of rape told jurors,

> _you have to look at the way she was dressed. She was wearing a thong with a lace front,_

leading to #ThisIsNotConsent trending on Twitter, protests in several cities, and women across the world sharing pictures of their underwear. The callousness and indifference of social media is addressed when the girls respond to pictures of Bartlett cross-dressing by laughing at his taste in lingerie. Another major issue in the film is, obviously, sexuality. For example, Bex is transgender (as is actress Hari Nef), and after she has sex with Diamond (Danny Ramírez), a fellow pupil, he casually asks her not to tell anyone, and then subsequently blanks her in school. Elsewhere, the girls are shocked to learn that Mark won't go down on Lily, with Sarah proclaiming, ""_men who don't go down are sociopaths_."" Very possibly.

Unfortunately, because the film tries to deal with so much, many of the issues are raised only to be touched on once or twice, and then dropped. This has the side-effect of making the film seem a little thematically scattershot, and it would have worked far better if Levinson had threaded a core group through the narrative rather than jumping around as much as he does. Aside from dealing with too many themes, if the film has a defining flaw, it's that the last act essentially turns into _The Purge_, wherein the girls, as complicit as everyone else in the early part of the film, now turn into the leaders of a righteous avenging vigilante group facing off against the intolerance born of right-wing jingoism, a conflict drawn primarily along gender lines, although not exclusively (there are a few men on the girls' side, and vice versa). Of the violence, Levinson tells filmschoolrejects.com,

> _it's real people imitating movie violence, in a way. It is informed by the symbolism of film violence._

Hari Nef tells Seventh Row,

> _the context of all of this hate and all of this judgment cues up the violence. You see the source of the violence, and you see the multiple forces — discursively, psychologically, culturally — that lead up to that moment. Obviously, the violence is shocking to see, but the fact that it's going on is as American as cherry pie. It's what happens in this country to people, to women, who are deemed guilty of something egregious. The fact that we get to see it is shocking, but the fact that it goes on should be very familiar._

Nevertheless, it's a disappointingly simplistic _dénouement_ given the complexity and thematic depth of the preceding narrative.

Another problem is that the characters are underwritten across the board, with only Lily and Bex really getting any degree of interiority. Sarah barely registers as a character at all, Em is only marginally better, and none of the other characters are developed beyond their archetypal role – Reagan Hall (Bella Thorne), a self-obsessed cheerleader; Nick Mathers (Joel McHale), Em's neighbour with a secret to hide; Grace (Maude Apatow), Reagan's quiet and submissive best friend; Marty (Noah Galvin), a local computer nerd; Nance (Anika Noni Rose), Em's adopted mother with terrible taste in men; Chief Patterson (J.D. Evermore), Salem's clueless chief of police; Rose Mathers (Susan Misner), Nick's wife; Lawrence Colson (Joe Chrest), Lily's old-fashioned father; Rebecca Colson (Kathryn Erbe), Lily's even more old-fashioned mother; and Donny Colson (Caden Swain), Lily's desensitised younger brother.

Depicting a cultural anxiety that is uniquely contemporary, _Assassination Nation_ is an unexpectedly smart film examining weighty topics of great importance to the socio-political moment, irrespective of your political affiliation. While it is immensely strong (both hilarious and disturbing) in its depiction of teenage gender politics, gun culture, political correctness, online behaviour etc, it falters when it comes to the dynamics of the narrative, setting up several strands which never pay off, and ending a little weakly. Nevertheless, the questions it raises are important ones, and they are asked very well. Levinson isn't interested in providing answers though.

- Richard Ford; _Wildlife_ (1990)

The directorial debut of actor Paul Dano, _Wildlife_ is based on the 1990 novel by Richard Ford, and is written for the screen by Dano and his girlfriend Zoe Kazan (with Dano also serving as producer, and Kazan as executive producer). Looking at the implosion of a family from the perspective of a 14-year-old member of said family, the film is thematically similar to Sam Mendes's _Revolutionary Road_ (it's at least partly about a couple falling out of love, and a marriage disintegrating), tonally similar to Derek Cianfrance's _Blue Valentine_ (a non-judgmental and regretful feeling pervades, with the film unwilling to cast either party as the villain), and aesthetically similar to the Texas scenes in Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_ (the period detail drips off the screen, whilst the use of a child as the focaliser colours much of what's depicted). And although _Wildlife_ is a piece of remarkably nostalgic filmmaking, at the same time, it tells somewhat of a progressive story. Subtly depicting an Americana on the cusp of massive social upheaval, the film demonstrates the uncertainty with which second-wave feminism manifested itself at a grassroots level prior to really taking off in 1963. Although it's essentially a character study, the film also suggests the 1950s-style clean-cut, neatly trimmed, rigidly defined way of life, built around the perfect nuclear family wherein a wife must be subservient to her husband, is about to become a thing of the past. Understated, restrained, narratively precise, but still granting the characters room to breathe, the film is emotional without being melodramatic, encouraging empathy without manipulating the audience. It does run the risk of seeming insurmountably old-fashioned to today's superhero-obsessed cinema goers, but, nevertheless, this is an accomplished piece of work for a first time director, suggesting Dano has been paying attention whilst working with auteurs such as Paul Thomas Anderson, Denis Villeneuve, Paolo Sorrentino, and Bong Joon-ho.

Set in Great Falls, Montana in 1960, the film tells the story of the peripatetic Brinson family; father Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), mother Jeannette (Carey Mulligan), and 14-year-old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould). Having moved to Montana due to financial problems, the family again finds itself in trouble when Jerry is fired from his job at a country club. Although the club asks him to return soon thereafter, his pride won't allow him, and he instead takes a position fighting a forest fire near the Canadian border for a dollar-an-hour. Meanwhile, Jeannette gets work as a swimming instructor, and Joe begins working part-time in a portrait photo parlour. When Jerry leaves to go north, Jeanette accuses him of abandoning the family, and, overnight, her behaviour changes dramatically; she starts to dress differently, to wear her hair differently, to speak differently, to cease doing housework, to talk ill of Jerry in front of Joe, etc. Striking up a friendship with one of her swimming students, Warren Miller (a superb Bill Camp), a wealthy World War II vet with a car dealership, who is clearly romantically interested in her despite the difference in their ages, Jeanette soon stops even trying to hide from Joe the fact that she is extremely unhappy with Jerry, and there may be no way to repair the damage.

Nestled behind that simple narrative are the fledgling social upheavals, still very much in their infancy, that would characterise the duration of the 1960s, particularly the notions of what a woman's role should be in the home and the very definition of family itself. Initially, Jeanette is depicted as a quintessential 1950s wife and mother, almost to the point of cliché; she cooks, cleans, washes the clothes, does the dishes, sees that Joe attend to his homework, and when Jerry loses his job, it is Jeanette who goes out looking for work for both of them. She knows that her (unspoken and unacknowledged) role in this patriarchal society is to hold the family together, and it's a role that is nothing like she thought it would be when she was younger. Although she and Jerry seem to love one another, or they certainly used to, she clearly feels trapped by her domestic situation, so when Jerry takes off in a misguided attempt to reaffirm his masculinity by fighting a forest fire, something in Jeanette either snaps, or clicks into place, depending on your perspective.

However, although Jeanette may know she no longer wants to be a housewife, she has no idea what she does want, and her attempts to find out form the bulk of the narrative's conflict. Set three years prior to Betty Friedan's ground-breaking _The Feminine Mystique_ (1963), which redefined the parameters of all gender-based topics, depicting a society in which women were not content to do their husband's bidding, raise children, and stay quiet, Jeanette's story could very well have formed the template for Friedan's analysis. Suffocated by her current situation, she sees little hope of escape, until she realises the opportunity that Jerry leaving has presented to her.

I've seen several reviewers criticise the fact Jeanette goes from dutiful mother and loyal wife to a no-longer-maternal and possible adulteress literally overnight. However, for me, the fact that the transformation happens so quickly is exactly the point; when she goes to bed, she's a wife and mother, trapped in her domestic environment, but when she wakes the next morning, she realises that she has an opportunity to escape, perhaps the best opportunity she will ever get. This has been building up for years, but she has gotten so used to feeling lost that when she gets a chance to change things, she doesn't even recognise it as such, at least not at first. Once she does, however, Jeanette makes a conscious decision to stop performing the role delegated by men. As much of the female population of the western hemisphere would be asking over the next ten or so years, Jeanette wants to know, ""_is this all there is?_"" She wants more than simply getting through the day. In this sense, she recalls Nora Helmer from Henrik Ibsen's _A Doll's House_ (1879), Laura Brown from Michael Cunningham's _The Hours_ (1998), or any number of Tennessee Williams heroines – a woman who wakes up to find she has become deeply unhappy despite attaining everything she once wanted, and who sets out to do whatever it takes to alter her course. Determined to forge a new identity, she is adamant she won't become one of the ""_standing dead_"" (the term used for trees that survive a forest fire). The question is, can she do so without completely destroying her family. The film may ostensibly be a coming-of-age drama, but Jeanette's existential crisis is the real meat and potatoes.

That all is not well in the Brinson household is hinted at in the opening scene, where Jerry and Jeanette have a couple of inconsequential but noticeable disagreements over dinner (such as whether Joe should continue pursuing football). This scene establishes an assuredness and subtlety-of-hand that lasts for the entire film, with Dano's directorial work proving unexpectedly sophisticated. For example, something he does several times is have characters walk off-screen to speak, whilst keeping the camera trained on Joe as he tries to listen, with the dialogue barely perceptible from just off the edge of the frame. As well as being an excellent use of off-screen space, something you don't see too often, this technique ties us rigidly to Joe's POV early on, inculcating us into his worldview. Another very nice piece of direction is an early montage cutting between Jeanette riding her bike, Jerry driving the car, and Joe riding the bus, in which each character is facing a different direction, each in isolation from the other two. It's basic cinematic shorthand, showing instead of telling, but it's very well done. Equally impressive is the penultimate scene, where Dano uses the windows of the Brinson house to block the characters in such a way as to suggest both their inner emotions, and the prevailing theme at this point of the film. For the most part, however, Dano's direction is invisible, relying far more on static painterly compositions than camera movement (which is not to say the camera _never_ moves). In this sense, Diego García's cinematography is not that different from what Joe himself is doing at his part-time job, something which again reinforces his subjective viewpoint.

Elsewhere, from an aesthetic point of view, the film's period detail is superb, with Akin McKenzie's production design, Miles Michael's art direction, and Amanda Ford's costume design absolutely immaculate. The school desks, the leg brace Miller wears, the supermarket layout, the radio, every detail seems utterly authentic. There is also an unnerving sense of calm throughout the whole film, but the kind of calm that seems posed to erupt into something undesirable at any time. Everything is measured and exact to the point where I was reminded of the work of Edward Hopper multiple times, particularly something like _Chop Suey_ (1929) or _Room in New York_ (1932).

The acting, as you would expect, is universally superb. On paper, Jeanette and Miller are very much the villains of the piece, but Mulligan and Camp's performances are so full of warmth and genuine emotion that you simply can't look at them as antagonists, and the film itself never judges them. I've been a big fan of Camp since his brilliant turn as Frank Nitti in Michael Mann's _Public Enemies_ (2009), and with films like this and his Emmy nominated performance in _The Night Of_ (2016), it's terrific to see him start to get the kudos he deserves. He's especially good in the scene where he tells Joe a story about switching off the engine of his airplane in mid-air so he could glide silently with a flock of geese. It could be a narcissistic boast, it could be a metaphorical bit of advice, it could be an attempt to win Joe over, or it could simply be a way to try to connect. In Camp's hands, it's all of these, and more, playing Miller as both a letch but also someone in possession of an innate kindness, not an easy balancing act to pull off by any means.

Mulligan, for her part, plays Jeanette as utterly weary, much older than her years, at times fragile, at times rock solid, both vulnerable and manipulative. Full of anger, she simply can't hold in her emotions any more. Unfortunately, in letting them out, she betrays Joe by forgetting he is only 14-years-old. When she starts drunkenly dancing with him at Miller's house, the scene is deeply uncomfortable, but Mulligan's performance is such that we don't condemn her, at least, not completely. She never allows the audience to lose sight of the fact that although she is behaving rather poorly, she is a prisoner, and is reacting against her restraints as best she can.

Gyllenhaal's performance is more understated than Mulligan's, but no less impressive. Playing Jerry as someone who likes a drink, perhaps a little too much, he is the kind of person who blames everybody else for everything, and refuses to see the bad in himself – he bitterly tells Joe he was fired from the country club ""_because people like me too much_."" Dano is also astute enough to give his actors plenty of room to react (which obviously comes from his own acting background). A great deal of time is spent showing characters looking, listening, thinking etc, acting via silence, which is not something you see a lot of these days.

Of course, there are a few problems. Essentially a tale of marital angst, the narrative is not especially original – we've seen this story before, many times in fact, and for all the craft on display, Dano never really manages to say anything wholly original. Additionally, his measured direction is also too good in places – everything is so ordered, neat, and trim, that at times, the milieu doesn't seem lived-in, but more an abstract concept of what the period was like. The film could do with being a little messier in places, both in terms of direction and in terms of what's actually on-screen. Additionally, there are a few lines that sound great on paper, but which are just not the kind of things one says in real life. For example, Jeanette tells Joe, ""_I feel like I need to wake up, but I don't know what from, or what to_"". Later she says, ""_I wish I was dead. If you have a better plan for me, tell me. Maybe it'll be better than this_"". This kind of dialogue seems more interested in hitting thematic waypoints than developing character beats. Similarly, late in the film, Jerry says to Joe, ""_It's a wild life. Isn't it, son?_"" Proclaiming the film's title in this context doesn't even remotely work, and the line feels totally out of place, to the point of ripping you out of the narrative.

On the one hand, _Wildlife_ is about how society was changing in 1960, and on the other, about how that change manifests itself within the Brinson family. Yes, it's another ""death of the American dream"" story in a long line of such films, but here, the focus is, for the most part, on character rather than theme, with Jeanette functioning in kind of a synecdochical manner; our specific entry point, she is the individual that facilitates an examination of the masses. And yes, Dano may take his eye off the ball a couple of times, with the odd bit of clunky dialogue, and a somewhat too picture-postcard perfection, but all in all, this is an excellent directorial debut.,","fire,montana,based on novel or book,bus,infidelity,golf,teenage boy,1960s,wildfire,",26,92,"Paul Dano,"

A man in 1905 Wales (Dan Stevens) goes undercover as a member of a weirdo cult to save his captive sister on an isolated island.

""Apostle"" (2018) has a similar plot to “The Wicker Man” (1973/2006) and a setting akin to “The Village” (2004) and “The Ritual” (2017), but it’s the least of these.

The first half is a decent set-up; a little dull, but nice and mysterious with a fantastic setting and village set. Unfortunately, the second half devolves into half-baked horror cheese with a couple of random torture scenes to supposedly keep things ""exciting."" 

I was shocked at how bad the second half was -- bad flow, no finesse, ill-conceived, lack of consistency, too ambiguous -- just lousy wannabe-horror filmmaking. It’s like the director needed 20 more minutes to properly tell the story, but was pressured to keep the movie as close to 2 hours as he could and so clumsily forced the footage in the second half together.

Nevertheless, the movie's provocative upon reflection, particularly its commentary on human-made hybrid religions and the potential for corruption and abuse thereof. Think Jeroboam's syncretic religion when the northern kingdom of Israel broke from Judah; he concocted two golden calf idols and appointed illegitimate ""priests."" It was influenced by Judaism and featured some of its trappings, but left out the most important part (God).

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot in Wales. I would like to see a ""Director's Cut"" that runs at least 2.5 hours with all the expository footage that was unfortunately left on the cutting room floor.

I'm not going to lie – I fully expected to hate _Black '47_. The trailer was awful, making it look like a generic action flick; several colleagues saw the screening at ADIFF earlier in the year and were decidedly unimpressed; I thought most of the film was in English, which rubbed me up the wrong way altogether. Mainly though, I was just fulfilling my God-given right as an Irish person – being cankerous for no earthly reason whatsoever. However, because I was expecting to hate it, when I discovered, much to my chagrin, that it's actually quite good, it led to me thoroughly enjoying it. Colour me humbled. Easily the most hyped and anticipated Irish film of the last decade or so, _Black '47_ is proudly advertised as the ""_first film about the Great Famine_"". And were this true, it would undoubtedly occupy a canonical place in Irish artistic output in general, and Irish cinema in specific. However, there is one vital factor that everyone really needs to know before seeing it – it isn't the first film about the Famine. It's the first film set during the Famine, but it isn't about the Famine. This is a genre film, a pseudo-western revenge thriller set against the backdrop of the Famine. The Famine is not the film's central theme, nor does it attempt to engage with it on a national scale. If you accept that, and don't go in expecting to see Cecil Woodham-Smith's _The Great Hunger_ (1991) transposed to the screen, there's actually quite a lot here to admire.

As with many genre films, the plot is simplicity itself. It is winter 1847 in Connemara, two years since _Phytophthora infestans_ caused the failure of the potato crop on which large portions of the country's poor depend. Having deserted from the British Army's 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) after a difficult tour in Afghanistan, Martin Feeney (James Frecheville) returns home, unaware of the state of the country; everywhere, there is eviction, homelessness, starvation, and death. As people literally lie dying on the sides of the road, hundreds of thousands have already left Ireland for the United States. With Protestant clerics exploiting the crisis to compel Catholics peasants to convert in return for soup (""_taking the soup_""), grain is stockpiled for export to England. Travelling to his home, Feeney learns his immediate family is dead; his brother sentenced to hanging for resisting eviction, and his mother driven off the land after refusing to take the soup, subsequently dying of starvation and exposure. The only remaining family he has are his sister-in-law Ellie (the always excellent Sarah Greene), and her three children. Holding up in an abandoned cottage, Feeney persuades Ellie to join him in emigrating. However, the following day, an eviction party, led by the unscrupulous bailiff Cronin (Aidan McArdle) and the sadistic Sgt. Fitzgibbon of the Irish Constabulary (yet another strong performance from Moe Dunford), arrives with orders to eject the family and burn the property. Things soon turn violent, and Feeney is arrested. Held in a nearby garrison, he escapes, and sets about exacting revenge on the judge who hanged his brother, the people in the eviction party, the landlord who ordered the eviction, and anyone else who gets in his way. Meanwhile, learning of Feeney's escape, the British Army send a three-man team after him; the idealistic and pompous Sgt. Pope (Freddie Fox), the naïve Pvt. Hobson (Barry Keoghan), and Feeney's former commander in the Rangers, the disillusioned and world-weary Hannah (Hugo Weaving). Considering Feeney a friend, Hannah is unenthusiastic about the mission, but has little choice, as he himself is awaiting execution, having killed a suspect he was supposed to be interrogating, and is told unless he brings Feeney back, his execution will go ahead. Soon joined by Conneely (Stephen Rea) as interpreter, bard, and geographical guide, the group set off after Feeney as he cuts an increasingly bloody path across the county towards the man his sees as the architect of the area's miseries; Lord Kilmichael (Jim Broadbent).

Before looking at why I enjoyed the film so much, a (very) small bit of background. The Famine is the single most significant event in Irish history; a cataclysmic tragedy on a biblical scale. Whilst you'll often hear it said that it was caused by either blight, an over-reliance on the potato crop, or colonial mismanagement (or organised genocide, if you believe Tim Pat Coogan), the fact is that it was the result of a myriad of factors, which, in 1845, combined to form a deadly perfect storm; bad luck, a natural occurrence, political ineptitude, pronounced socio-economic disparity, racism, massive poverty, national arrogance, etc. What is certain, however, is that it was a _completely_ preventable tragedy; even after the blight was initially recognised in 1844 (one year _prior_ to the crop failure), landowners continued to export grain. By the time 1847 had come around, the Irish Poor Law Extension Act had made Irish property owners fully responsible for public relief, and the ""Gregory Clause"" stated that any famer with at least a quarter of an acre was not eligible for such relief. The Amendment and the Clause, both ostensibly intended to ease the poor's suffering, had a catastrophic effect on the country, leading to an unprecedented rise in evictions. This was because the property tax assigned to pay for the Poor Law was levied on each rented holding, meaning it fell on landlords. Facing the possibility of this drastically increased taxation, many simply sidestepped the problem by evicting their tenants and destroying the dwellings. Simultaneously, due to the Gregory Clause, tens of thousands of tenants were trying to sell most of their land to the landlords so they could qualify for relief. However, because of the Amendment, many landlords refused to accept partial land surrenders, demanding instead the entire holding, plus the dwelling, which they could then burn, leading to a vicious cycle of homelessness, poverty, and destitution.

Between 1845 and 1852, around one-and-a-half million people died and nearly two million emigrated, reducing the populace by roughly 25% (1847 is known as ""Black '47"" because both the death and emigration rates were at their highest). In a lot of ways, the country still hasn't recovered; the Irish language was laid to waste; the myths and sagas of Irish folklore were forgotten for decades, until the advent of the Celtic Twilight and the _Athbheochan na Gaeilge_, and even with these movements, large portions of the folklore have never been reintegrated into the zeitgeist; the proud tradition of Irish bards changed forever, with thousands of songs lost; Irish literature slowed down to a trickle, taking over a hundred years before returning to its pre-Famine affluence; and hatred of the English occupiers became more galvanised than at any point in the previous 700 years of their presence – the common man blamed the Famine on the English, and for the first time, the poor and uneducated began to think along the lines of political insurgency.

The Famine was so devastating that even Irish literature, one of the finest literary traditions in the world, was reluctant to engage with it, both at the time, and ever since. Beyond a few poems by the likes of James Clarence Mangan, Aubrey De Vere, and Thomas D'Arcy McGee, isolated poetry like ""Thanatos, 1849"", and a few novels such as William Carleton's _The Black Prophet: A Tale of Irish Famine_ (1847), there really is no such thing as ""Famine literature"", certainly no Famine literary tradition. And even since then, the national literature has proved reluctant to engage, with only a few texts such as Patrick Kavanagh's _The Great Hunger_ (1942) and Seamus Heaney's ""At a Potato Digging"" (1966) willing to address it (even the masters, W.B. Yeats and James Joyce themselves, never explicitly dealt with the Famine head-on).

All of which brings us to _Black '47_. Considering how important an event this is in Irish history, it is as conspicuous by its absence from the national cinema as it is from the national literature. Here, however, there are practical considerations beyond the thematic enormity of the task; representing something of this scale and with this level of suffering is massively difficult on film, especially with a limited budget. And in any case, how does one fashion a narrative which could possibly convey the bleakness of the Famine. Maybe in this era of long-form narrative on TV, there's a possibility of doing something Famine-related, but condensing the most significant seven years in Irish history into a two (or three, or four) hour film is nigh-on impossible, not to mention the sheer unrelenting misery one would need to put on screen. It wouldn't exactly be a crowd-pleaser – watching an entire country slowly starve to death probably isn't going to pack Marvel fanboys into the local multiplex. And so, with that in mind, Black '47 has no intentions of dealing with the Famine on that kind of scale. This is a genre piece, it's a western, a revenge thriller. It's basically Clint Eastwood's _The Outlaw Josey Wales_ (1976), with Feeney having more than a hint of the Man with No Name.

In this sense, using the Famine as a backdrop for a genre exercise is probably a wise choice – it allows limited engagement by way of a plot-driven story, without setting up massive expectations (advertising hyperbole aside) and unconquerable thematic hurdles. Speaking to the _Irish Independent_, co-screenwriter/director Lance Daly explains,

> _the genre route was the only way to go. I mean, do you want to make a film that's just about suffering, about people watching their children starve and families lying dead in their homes? Do you want to watch it, do you want to make it, do you want to be someone who tries to dramatise that? You had to tackle it in a less direct way._

And whilst grafting an historical tragedy onto a generic template runs the risk of the tragedy muting the genre elements, and the genre distracting from the tragedy, Daly and his fellow screenwriters, Pierce Ryan, P.J. Dillon, and Eugene O'Brien, make a fine stab at it.

Doing it this way also makes a great deal of sense for a number of additional reasons. For example, no Famine narrative could ever depict a story in which a protagonist rights all the wrongs of Ireland, because no such person existed. However, the relatively contained story of Feeney's revenge is more than aware of that. He is never painted as someone out to liberate the country, spurred on by the wrongs done to him personally – he's no Mel Gib…sorry, William Wallace. He wants revenge on the people who wronged him; he has no aspirations of saving Ireland, and is powerless to do anything on a larger socio-economic canvas. The film never lets the audience forget this, whether it be shots of Feeney emotionlessly riding past starving peasants on the roadside, or his invasion of a Protestant soup tent, where he eats his own fill and then leaves. He's not the avenging spirit of Ireland made flesh, he's not Cú Chulainn, Fionn mac Cumhaill, or one of the Tuatha Dé Danann. This is not a piece of nationalist wish fulfilment, and it makes no claim to be.

In terms of how the film represents the Famine, apart from its importance to the plot, Daly employs a number of what could be called ""quintessential Famine images"". These include one of the first shots in the film, which shows a skull sinking into the wet mud, representing the dead and their connection to the land (a little on the nose, but it does the job); when Ellie first appears, she looks like Caitlín Ní Uallacháin, the implication being that Ireland itself is literally dying; when Ellie and her children are evicted, the scene is very much an archetype of such evictions – women and children crying, men being restrained, the thatched roof of a cottage burning, callous bailiffs, brutalising police; a Catholic priest warning the starving peasants not to take the soup (Feeney's disdain for this priest recalls the scene in Jim Sheridan's _The Field_ (1990) when the Bull McCabe (Richard Harris) reminds Fr. Doran (Sean McGinley) ""_no priests died in the time of the Famine, only poor people_""); peasants taking the soup, a scene which throws up one of the most controversial and long-lasting ramifications of the Famine (more on this in a moment); grain being stockpiled for export to England; bedraggled peasants huddled at the gates of an affluent estate, begging the rich occupants to give them food, in a scene visually reminiscent of Rowan Gillespie's _Famine_ memorial on Dublin's Custom House Quay); multiple references to emigration. In point of fact, although the Famine is essentially just background, Daly works hard to make sure the viewer never forgets what's happening beyond the edges of the frame, by occasionally allowing it within the frame.

One of the reasons I thought I was going to hate _Black '47_ was because I thought it was entirely in English, which would have been patently ridiculous. Perhaps the most long-lasting effect of the Famine is that it decimated _Gaeilge_, the Irish language. The Famine is why this review is in English, and why I can speak only a few sentences in my native tongue. In seven years, the Famine did what the English couldn't manage in 700 – it destroyed that which defined us as a people, our very national identity. However, not only are large sections of _Black '47_ in Irish, the film actually uses the Irish language and the attempts to suppress it as an important recurring motif. For example, Feeney speaks both English and Irish, but he makes a conscious decision to only speak Irish, even when talking to non-Irish speakers, several of whom demand he speak in English. The film also shows a judge (Dermot Crowley) erupting in anger as peasants in his courtroom, unable to speak English, begin to converse in Irish, whilst Kilmichael refers to Gaeilge as ""_that aboriginal gibberish_"". However, the most important scene concerning the Irish language is one which recalls the linguistic brilliance of Brian Friel's play, Translations (1980). In the Protestant soup kitchen, when the priest asks a peasant his name, the man replies ""_Séamus Ó Súilleabháin_"". The priest turns around to a translator, who responds, ""_James Sullivan_"". This speaks to the Anglicisation of Irish place names by the British (Béal an Átha became Ballina, Dún Dealgan became Dundalk, Trá Lí became Tralee, etc), itself an attempt to destroy the language and undermine our sense of place. Daly never allows the devastating effect the Famine had on the language to fade too far into the background, and the narrative is all the better for it.

The film also seems to have one eye on the contemporary political climate. For example, the scenes of English gentry seizing land and demolishing homes perhaps alludes to the situation in Palestine, where Israeli forces can be seen doing essentially the same thing. Even more pertinent, and closer to home, the scenes of empty dwellings, as people try to survive in ditches, clearly alludes to the ludicrous phenomenon of empty, boarded-up houses found all over Dublin, which, for some reason best known to the council, can't be let out to the ever-increasing number of homeless families. Similarly, the scenes of people dying on the side of the road recalls the bitter 2018 winter, when four homeless people died on the streets of Dublin within a few weeks of one another. Even the eviction scene is comparable to contemporary events; just last week, at the behest of a landlord, balaclava wearing Gardaí, flanked by private security personnel (also wearing balaclavas), violently evicted a peaceful Take Back the City protest which had occupied an empty house in Dublin so as to highlight the growing homeless crisis.

Looking beyond the Famine, thematically, the film hits the ground running; the first scene is Hannah's murder of his prisoner, which is preceded by a short debate between the two on the issue of loyalty to one's nation vs duty to the Crown, a duality with which Hannah wrestles for the duration of the plot. Indeed, speaking of Hannah, he and Feeney are very much two sides of the same coin; they are, for all intents and purposes, Javert and Jean Valjean, locked into a pursuit by a system neither of them respect. In fact, in relation to this, whereas Hugo gradually fazes Javert out of the narrative, Daly goes in the opposite direction – as the film progresses, Hannah comes to the fore and Feeney drops into the background. This has the effect of making Feeney seem almost non-human, an elemental force who turns up now and again when things kick off, and it's a really well handled structural component.

Of course, all of this is not to say the film is perfect. Composer Brian Byrne's score, which features a heavy usage of uilleann pipes, is decent, but overly didactic. Additionally, the character of Kilmichael is something of a clichéd, token villain, coming out with lines such as ""_this potato business has simplified things considerably_"". Daly also has a slight tendency to unsuccessfully mix naturalism with stylisation, perhaps most obvious in the use of intentionally artificial looking matte paintings as backgrounds in some of the panoramic scenes. Whilst the intention behind this was most likely to try to evoke the look of old sepia photographs, contemporary audiences used to photorealistic CGI in every shot will probably interpret it as cheap effects work, which is a shame, and does the film no favours. Finally, if there's one thing I was surprised that wasn't mentioned, especially given all the references to emigration, it would be the coffin ship, the image of which is a permanent component of the Famine's legacy in Ireland.

However, all things considered, this is a strong and reasonably important piece of filmmaking. Yes, it's essentially just a revenge western, and yes, in that sense, it's nothing overly special; there are a hundred films along these lines, and several of them are better than _Black '47_. However, Daly allows the Famine background to come to the fore sufficiently so that we never forget when and where we are, and because of this, it's undoubtedly an important film. Mixing the historical with the generic just enough so that each informs the other without either becoming (too) diluted, it's not the first ""Famine film"", but it is a very decent, honest, and respectful attempt to put something (anything) of that great tragedy on screen. And that is something to be lauded.,An exploration of a gruelling moment in Irish history, ‘Black ‘47’ toys with notions of ethics in an amoral world, questioning the very existence of redemption and showing the guy on the white horse as a reluctant, mournful participant in a (possibly) never-ending cycle of violence.

Anyone who knows me will know that I'm fan of dark and dreary movies and the Netflix movie _Black 47_ certainly meets this description.

_In 1847, when Ireland is in the grip of the Great Famine that has ravaged the country for two long years, Feeney, a hardened Irish Ranger who has been fighting for the British Army abroad, returns home to reunite with his estranged family, only to discover the cruelest reality, a black land where death reigns._

I love a good revenge film and this delivers on its promise of a cold hard story. This is a real solid film that had me gripped right from the get-go. James Frecheville who plays Feeney is dead eyed and terrifying as he slowly tracks down those that have done wrong to his family, and you can't help but cheer him on as the a-hole English soldiers chase him. Hugo Weaving is great as Hannah, the former soldier tasked with helping the English chase Feeney, and the cat and mouse game that ensues really pulled me in. The conflict that Hannah has plays well into the story, and his ""in it for his own reasons"" angle adds a good ""will he or won't he"" aspect to the events of the film.

The film makers do an excellent job of showing just how hard and awful things were during the Irish famine, and how cheap life was. There is a courthouse scene where someone is sentenced to hard labour in Tasmania, half a world away for the crime of stealing a sheep to feed his family. In fact that mention of Tasmania, and the film as a whole reminded me a lot of the absolutely brilliant film _The Nightingale_, that we watched last year. If you enjoyed _The Nightingale_ then this too will be right up your alley.

So, if you're looking for a bleak and hopeless film with a huge grey zone between good guys and bad guys, _Black 47_ will be a worthy addition to your watchlist.,","deserter,famine,revenge,tenant,poverty,ireland,bad landlord,landlord tenant relationship,starvation,19th century,manhunt,british occupation,connemara,",20,46,"Lance Daly,"

_I knew there was an old axe down cellar; that is all I knew._

- Stefani Koorey quoting Lizzie Borden; _The Preliminary Hearing in the Lizzie Borden Case_ (2005)

Written by Bryce Kass, and directed by Craig William Macneill, _Lizzie_ is based on the _cause célèbre_ of Lizzie Borden (not to be confused with director Lizzie Borden, or extreme porn star/director Lizzy Borden), who was accused and subsequently acquitted of the axe murders of her father and stepmother in Fall River, Massachusetts in 1892, a crime that is still officially unsolved. A ""_smash-the-patriarchy_"" (to use a quote from producer and star Chloë Sevigny) revisionist take on the material, the film presents Borden as a protofeminist lashing out against patriarchal oppression, homophobia, and sexual assault. Strikingly contemporary in its thematic concerns, this long-time passion project for Sevigny adopts the perspective of the #MeToo movement, proposing a version of events wherein Borden is forced to actively fight back against a lifetime of subjugation. Although the languid pace will alienate many viewers, whilst the liberties it takes with historical facts will irk others, there is much to praise here, including fantastic cinematography, terrific sound design, and flawless acting.

The film begins on the day of the murders, August 4, 1892, with Borden (a terrific Chloë Sevigny) and housemaid Bridget Sullivan (Kristen Stewart, with a surprisingly convincing Irish accent) working in the garden moments before the bodies are discovered. The narrative then jumps back six months, presenting the family dynamic leading up to the murders. 32-years-old, Borden lives with her domineering father, Andrew (a lecherous Jamey Sheridan); stepmother, Abby (Fiona Shaw), and elder sister, Emma (a criminally underused Kim Dickens). Although the Borden family are prominent members of the community, Andrew is well-known for frugality, refusing to install indoor plumbing or electric lights in the house, believing them ""_extravagances_"". When Sullivan arrives as a live-in housemaid, she and Borden quickly grow close, with Borden attempting to teach her to read and write. Meanwhile, the family is receiving written threats, which Borden believes are connected to her father's land acquisitions. Overhearing Andrew discussing his will with his brother-in-law, John Morse (a slimy Denis O'Hare), Borden is shocked to learn Andrew plans to leave everything to Abby. She later discovers that Andrew is regularly sexually assaulting Sullivan. Eventually, the friendship between Borden and Sullivan turns romantic. However, when Andrew learns of it, he forbids Borden from seeing Sullivan again, something Borden refuses to accept.

Well-known in the US because of the nursery rhyme, this is actually the first theatrical feature to depict Borden's story, although it has been adapted many times for other mediums; a 1948 Agnes de Mille ballet (_Fall River Legend_), a 1952 Michael Brown musical number (in _New Faces of 1952_), a 1961 Chad Mitchell Trio song (""Lizzie Borden""), a 1965 Jack Beeson opera (_Lizzie Borden_), a 1975 Paul Wendkos-directed TV movie (_The Legend of Lizzie Borden_), a 1980 Sharon Pollock play (_Blood Relations_), a 1984 Evan Hunter novel (_Lizzie_), a 1985 Angela Carter short story (""The Fall River Axe Murders""), a 1989 Walter Satterthwait novel (_Miss Lizzie_), a 1998 Christopher McGovern and Amy Powers musical (_Lizzie Borden_), and a 2014 Nick Gomez-directed TV movie (_Lizzie Borden Took an Ax_), which led to a limited series (_The Lizzie Borden Chronicles_).

The idea for the film originated with Sevigny herself, who brought it to Kass to write as a TV miniseries almost a decade ago. The script was sold to HBO in 2011, but by the time the network decided to move forward with the project, Lifetime's _Lizzie Borden Took an Ax_ was nearing completion. When it spawned _The Lizzie Borden Chronicles_, HBO decided against proceeding with Sevigny's version, so she and Kass purchased the rights back, with Kass adapting the script into a feature film. Pieter Van Hees was hired to direct, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced by Macneill. The idea that Borden and Sullivan were lovers is not original to Kass's script, as it was first posited in Hunter's novel. He theorised that Abby had caught the girls having sex, firing Sullivan, and prompting Borden to kill her. When Andrew returned home, Borden confessed, but when he reacted with horror, she also killed him. In later life, Borden was rumoured to be a lesbian, but there was no such speculation about Sullivan, who moved to Butte, Montana and got married. Speaking to the _Huffington Post_ at Sundance 2018, Sevigny revealed she was somewhat disappointed with the finished film, stating

> _almost everything that was on the page was filmed, and a lot of it didn't make it in the movie. More stuff with me and Fiona Shaw. There was more to the relationships that made them more complicated, and also then informed why Lizzie did it. Now it's a little more vague than what Bryce and I intended._

One of most interesting aspects of _Lizzie_ is its narrative structure. Beginning on August 4 just as the (unseen) bodies are discovered, it then flashes back six months to Sullivan's arrival in the Borden house. Building up to August 4 again, this time we are shown the bodies, but we don't see the murders. It then jumps forward to the trial, before once again flashing back to August 4, this time showing us the actual killing. This pseudo-_In Cold Blood_ structure is well-handled for the most part, and has a number of advantages. For one, it allows the film to briefly cover the trial, whilst still employing the murders as a powerful and very effective _dénouement_. It also allows the film to build tension around an event which the audience know is coming; by not showing the killings (twice), it has the effect that when the film does actually depict them, they are all the more impactful, placing a suitable cap on what is essentially a story of forbidden love.

From an aesthetic point of view, there's much to praise, with Noah Greenberg's cinematography particularly laudable. Often framing Borden in windows, doorways, and behind railings, whilst also using shallow focus to flatten backgrounds, the sense is that this is a woman living a confined life with little room to move, trapped in her immediate environment. When she and Sullivan first kiss, the camera pulls back to reveal that Andrew is watching them – even in this moment of release, they are still trapped in his domain. Borden is also often shot off-centre, or reflected in mirrors, particularly as she talks to someone who is on camera. This reinforces the sense that she is trapped, and also feeds into the metaphorical meaning of a later scene where she spreads the shards of a broken mirror outside the door of Sullivan's room to cut her father's feet as he emerges.

Dank and airless, the dimly lit Borden household, outside of which the film rarely ventures, is practically another character in and of itself. Complimenting Elizabeth J. Jones's production design, Greenberg's photography gives rise to a restrictive and claustrophobic _mise en scène_, which is often lit with only a single candle. However, it's not just how he lights scenes that impresses, it's also how he uses the camera; gliding over important details without hammering home why we should be paying attention (the first time we see the hatchet, for example). Also worth mentioning is how Macneill uses the full-frontal nudity towards the end of the film. Although it will no doubt be accused of gratuitousness by some, it's not only historically accurate, it's shocking, necessary, and makes a powerful statement. God forbid a woman should ever appear naked on screen in a scene _not_ of a sexual nature. Assisting Greenberg's photography and Jones's design is Ruy García's superb sound design. Of particular note are the floorboards, which creak with the slightest touch, making any kind of clandestine interaction between Borden and Sullivan virtually impossible, and thus contributing to the sense of the household as a prison. Enhancing this even further, is the lack of warmth in the sound design, with footsteps and voices echoing and bouncing off the walls due to the lack of any soft surfaces.

As a narrative of female empowerment (albeit of the homicidal variety), most of the film's main themes relate to combating the patriarchal strictures of the Gilded Age, represented primarily by Andrew and John, both loathsome characters in their own way, and Abby, who reinforces patriarchal hypocrisy by unquestioningly submitting to it (she is well aware that Andrew is abusing Sullivan, for example). Talking to the _Huffington Post_, Sevigny explains,

> _we just really wanted to focus on how she went about finding [her freedom] and how important that was to her and what that meant to her. Whether it was through the relationship with Bridget or ultimately killing her parents for money – because money equalled freedom then. It still does. I wanted it to be this rousing, smash-the-patriarchy piece and then she gets everything she wants, monetarily – the capitalist dream._

Presenting Borden as a woman driven to her wit's end, with few practical options in a society that looks down on her because she is unwed and in her 30s, the film depicts a free-spirit living in a cage, yearning for agency, with the murders presented, at least in part, as her attempt to break free of such restrictions. Suffocated by unquestioned authoritarian patriarchal rule, Borden essentially becomes a protofeminist heroine, actively rebelling against the dominion of men and the women who enable them.

Sullivan, who acts as the audience's moral compass, faces different obstacles, primarily related to economics and social caste. Her place in the ideological and socio-economic hierarchy is manifested in the fact that the family call her Maggie (the generic name given to all Irish servants). However, Borden's insistence on calling her by her actual name (which is historically inaccurate, as Borden also called her Maggie) lays the groundwork for their later emotional connection. Presenting their relationship as an illicit romance which they had to hide because of the moral bigotry of the age, the film very much adopts a #MeToo sensibility, as Borden and Sullivan fight back against self-righteous judgement, unchecked abuse, and socially sanctioned oppression. In this sense, when Borden and Sullivan strip naked before the murders, they aren't just undressing to avoid getting incriminating blood on their clothes, they are repudiating the garments that have restricted them in a physical sense just as much as men have in an ideological sense.

There are, however, some sizeable problems in all of this. For one, the film lacks energy, and the slow pacing will leave some viewers bored to tears. Additionally, apart from Sevigny and Stewart, the rest of the cast is wasted, particularly Shaw, O'Hare, and Dickens (who only has a handful of scenes, and is virtually a background extra). None of their characters come across as possessing any kind of interiority, instead existing almost exclusively as archetypes; the wicked stepmother, the lecherous uncle, and the ice-cold older sister. Additionally, although he has a lot more to do, Sheridan's Andrew is completely over-the-top, only one or two beats away from a moustache-twirling mega-villain. Perhaps the most egregious problem is that the film seems as war with itself. On the one hand, it wants to be an elegant, period-appropriate tale of women attempting to take their destinies into their own hands in a Victorian society not predisposed to allow such, but on the other, it wants to present a modern story of murder and homosexual women (Patty Jenkins's _Monster_ (2003) in corsets, if you will). At times, such as the superb depiction of the murders themselves, you can feel the modern sensibilities rise to the surface, but for the most part, they're stifled by the hushed austerity of the more muted _milieu_.

_Lizzie_ tells the story of an initially powerless victim who lashes out and, quite literally, slays patriarchal authority. Just by giving Sevigny the first significant starring role of her career, the film earns a lot of brownie points, as she's been an unsung, but consistently brilliant supporting player since her debut in Larry Clark's _Kids_ (1995). Alongside her, Stewart equates herself very well, even having a decent go at an Irish accent, and the passion between the two, though period-appropriately muted, is completely believable. However, the film's attempts to shoehorn in 21st century moral values doesn't entirely work, primarily because Kass's script tips the scale in Borden's favour to a ridiculous degree – there's Andrew's over-the-top villainy (not just an authoritarian homophobe, but a rapist to boot), John's creepy intimations, Abby's refusal to stand up for her step-daughters, Borden's protofeminist rhetoric and humanitarianism, the alterations to historical fact to ensure the audience is never in any doubt as to where its sympathies are supposed to lie. Weighing the scales so decisively drains the film of any ambiguity and most of its vitality, presenting a binary story of righteous good slaying hypocritical evil, rather than a murder with many facets. A Gothic tale told from a #MeToo perspective, _Lizzie_ tries to be many things at once – a revisionist history, a feminist tract, a championing of homosexuality, a murder mystery, a period drama – but ends up kind of falling into a no man's land between genres. Still though, there are aspects of the film that are enjoyable, if you can look past the enervating pace.,","biography,last will and testament,axe murder,housemaid,lizzie borden,murder trial,19th century,abusive father,father daughter relationship,",18,174,"Craig Macneill,"

- David Grann quoting Forrest Tucker; ""The Old Man and the Gun""; _The New Yorker_ (January 27, 2003)

Of all the young American writer/directors to break through in the last few years, for me, Jeff Nichols and David Lowery stand tall; in particular, Nichols's _Take Shelter_ (2011), and Lowery's _Ain't Them Bodies Saints_ (2013) and the existential masterpiece that was _A Ghost Story_ (2017). Both filmmakers are five-for-five thus far, with even Lowery's 2016 mainstream Disney remake _Pete's Dragon_ managing to impress in all sorts of ways I wasn't expecting. Apart from being enjoyable in its own right, it also showed us that Lowery is as comfortable making personal small-scale character dramas as he is big-budget special effects blockbusters. With _The Old Man & the Gun_, he stands somewhere between – it's not as intimate as _St. Nick_ (2009), _Ain't Them Bodies Saints_, or _A Ghost Story_, but neither is it as mainstream as _Pete's Dragon_. Originally touted as Robert Redford's final performance, although he has walked that claim back somewhat, _The Old Man & the Gun_ is a laid-back ballad-like elegy to both the character Redford is playing _and_ to Redford himself. Filmed in the style of a 1970's indie, _Old Man_ is so tied to Redford as a performer as to be virtually self-referential. In short, if you're not a fan of the actor, you will get absolutely nothing from this film.

Telling the ""mostly true"" story of Forrest Tucker (the career criminal, not the prolific actor), Lowery's script is based primarily on David Grann's 2003 _New Yorker_ article of the same name, which was later collected in his book, _The Devil & Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness & Obsession_ (2010). By the time of the article, the 83-year-old Tucker, who had been robbing banks since his early 20s, had amassed at least 80 successful jobs and escaped from prison 18 times. Usually described by the tellers from whom he stole as ""gentlemanly"" and ""charming"", his M.O. never changed – he would walk into a bank and ask if he could open an account. When asked what kind, he would pull back his coat, showing his gun (which was often unloaded, and which he never fired), assure the teller that he didn't want any trouble, and quietly talk them through the process of emptying their till. He would then wish them the best, tell them they'd done well, and walk out. The story takes place in 1981, when Tucker was 61 (although in the film, he's 76), and had recently escaped from San Quentin. Although he usually works alone, he does have two colleagues, Teddy (Danny Glover) and Waller (Tom Waits), in what the press later dubs the ""Over-the-Hill Gang"". Fleeing from police pursuit after pulling off his first job since escaping, Tucker pulls over to help Jewel (Sissy Spacek), a widow whose car has broken down on the highway. He doesn't do it out of gallantry, but as a way to hide in plain sight; what kind of person being chased by police would stop to help someone fix their car? Heading to a nearby diner for a bite, Tucker and Jewel strike up a tentative romance. Initially, he tells her he is in sales, but shortly thereafter tells her what he really does, something she's not sure whether to believe. Meanwhile, when he pulls off a job in a bank where Det. John Hunt (Casey Affleck, playing, for a change, Casey Affleck) is queuing, completely unaware of what is happening right behind him, Tucker finds himself closely pursued by Hunt who, having just turned 40, is going through a mid-life crisis, which his wife Maureen (Tika Sumpter) can do little to dispel. The longer Hunt chases Tucker, however, the more he comes to respect him.

Redford himself brought Grann's article and Tucker's story to Lowery's attention, who subsequently wrote the script specifically for Redford (who also produces). In 1986, whilst imprisoned in San Quentin, Tucker underwent a quadruple bypass, and subsequently began documenting his exploits. Initially writing _Alcatraz: The True Story_, a two-hundred-and-sixty-one page manuscript about how he had escaped from Alcatraz in the 50s (actually, although he was an inmate of Alcatraz, he escaped from an LA hospital whilst having a kidney operation), he then wrote an autobiography called _The Can Opener_, in which he described himself as a ""_highly intelligent, nonviolent type of criminal in the Willie Sutton mould_."" He was released in 1993 and settled with his wife in Pompano Beach, Florida, where he earned a living giving saxophone and clarinet lessons, and occasionally playing the local jazz clubs. Turning _The Can Opener_ into a script, he tried to recruit Clint Eastwood to direct and star, but was told by Eastwood's secretary, ""_unless you have an agent, he won't read it_."" Tucker was re-arrested in 1999 after carrying out at least four robberies, and in 2000, he was sentenced to thirteen years. He died of natural causes in 2004 whilst imprisoned at Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth. In terms of the film, most of the details of Tucker's life are reasonably accurate, although Jewel is a fictional character. She is, however, loosely based on Tucker's third wife, Jewell Centers, whom he married in 1982. Hunt is also a real person, although, he was a sergeant in Austin, not a detective in Dallas, and he was unmarried and childless (in the film, Hunt and Maureen have two children).

The first thing you'll notice about _Old Man_ is its pace, which is measured, to say the least. Ostensibly, this is a heist film, but the crime narrative is very much secondary to tone and character beats. Lowery is relatively uninterested in excitement, suspense, plot twists, or any of the usual generic tropes. Instead, approaching the material casually, he focuses on a year of Tucker's life. You learn pretty quickly, however, what kind of film this will be. Opening with Tucker in mid-robbery, instead of concentrating on his escape, as you would expect, Lowery instead cuts from the robbery to Tucker meeting Jewel, and from that, to a lengthy dialogue scene in a diner as Tucker and Jewel get to know one another. Just as you expect important plot details and character-illustrative moments to be front and centre in a bombastic opening salvo, Lowery gives us two people sitting in a diner talking to one another. And this establishes the tone for the rest of the film, which is as mellow as a film can be; rather than a shot of absinthe, it's a fine Irish malt drunk at a fireplace.

Indeed, even within this structure, there's not a huge amount of character development, nor is there much of a dramatic arc. And that's not a criticism. Rather, the meditative, quasi-somnolent pace is very much one of the film's charms. To give you an example, about three-quarters of the way through, there's a scene where Jewel fills a kettle as she stares out the window. We are literally watching her thinking. Then she puts the kettle on the stove and thinks some more. The scene lasts a couple of minutes, and is reminiscent of Rooney Mara's four-minute pie-eating scene in _A Ghost Story_, which a lot of people disliked, but which I thought was very much the essence of the film rendered in pure visual form. Here, the kettle scene doesn't forward the narrative one iota. It's precisely the kind of scene that a young filmmaker would be told to avoid in film school. However, it's a key scene for the character, and although the film is only 93 minutes long, Lowery is in absolutely no rush to get through such scenes. Indeed, the heist scenes are very much the background noise against which the more interesting character beats happen. Additionally, Lowery almost completely ignores what, for many, would be the most interesting part of Tucker's story – his 18 escapes. Instead, Lowery puts them all together into one superb montage.

However, for all that, Lowery's primary goal is not to tell the story of Tucker, or even to introduce the character to the audience. It's to create an ode to an icon, and that icon is Robert Redford. Tucker's story is basically a vehicle which Lowery uses to celebrate Redford; the character is always there, but he exists behind the actor, rather than the other way around. What I mean by this is perhaps best explained by citing its inverse – an actor disappearing into a character; think Daniel Day-Lewis in Paul Thomas Anderson's _Phantom Thread_ (2017). In _Old Man_, the audience is never allowed to forget that this is Robert Redford on screen, to the point where the performance is self-referential. Indeed, during the escape montage, there's even a clip of Redford from another film, Arthur Penn's _The Chase_ (1966). There's an obvious correlation between Tucker and Redford of which Lowery wants the audience to be very aware – they are both elderly, and still doing what they do best, reluctant to stop, with a massive CV to prove it. We can never look past the fact that Tucker is played by Redford, and for the most part, Redford is playing Redford, with the film existing in large part only because it explicitly leans on his back catalogue and real-life legacy. Essentially, the whole thing is an extended metatextual allegory for Redford's own impending retirement, not to mention his reluctance to let go.

As one would expect from Lowery, aesthetically, the film is fascinating. Lowery is very unusual in the sense that, thus far, he has never used the same cinematographer twice – _St. Nick_ was shot by Clay Liford; _Ain't Them Bodies Saints_ by Bradford Young; _Pete's Dragon_ by Bojan Bazelli; _A Ghost Story_ by Andrew Droz Palermo; and _Old Man_ by Joe Anderson. Stylistically, the film is most similar to _A Ghost Story_, which was shot 1.33:1. _The Old Man & the Gun_ is 2.39:1, but the cinematography is extremely unique, with the celluloid having a gritty, grainy quality, almost as if it were an amateur project. This is because Lowery shot on Super 16, doing so because he wanted it to look like it had been made in the period in which it was set. This is in direct contrast to, say, how Michael Mann shot _Public Enemies_ (2009), which was 2.35:1, shot on Kodak Vision3 500T 5219 film with modern Arriflex 235s, Arriflex 435s, Sony CineAlta F23s, Sony CineAlta HDC-F950s, and Sony PMW-EX1s, with the use of fast, seemingly anachronistic, digital photography creating a sense that what was happening on screen wasn't necessarily taking place in the past, but could easily have been taking place right now. Lowery, in contrast, tries to suture the viewer into the past _milieu_.

In relation to this, Anderson tells _Filmmaker Magazine_,

> _when making a period piece, I think to really do it well and transport the audience back in time you have to acknowledge the way movies were made in the period that the story is set in._

He also tells _Deadline_,

> _we didn't take an overly technical approach to the cinematography. Sometimes there's little bumps in camera moves, and a pan isn't necessarily perfectly controlled, and it has a lot of personality._

Additionally, the news broadcasts were shot using period-accurate video equipment. Initially, the producers wanted to shoot on cheaper digital and then degrade the images, but Anderson insisted on using '80s-era video cameras.

Another important aesthetic point is how much Lowery has obviously been influenced by the aforementioned Mann, to whom there are several homages – the diner scene recalls a similarly shot scene between James Caan and Tuesday Weld in _Thief_ (1981); the scene in the toilet where Hunt approaches Tucker is an obvious nod to Al Pacino confronting Robert De Niro in _Heat_ (1995); and the scene of Tucker gaining inspiration whilst sitting in a cinema recalls a scene where Dillinger (Johnny Depp) does the same thing in _Public Enemies_. In relation to this scene, the movie Tucker is watching is Monte Hellman's _Two-Lane Blacktop_ (1971), a film depicting the openness and freedom of the American highway. Of this choice, Lowery tells _SlashFilm_,

> _I didn't intend for that movie to be in the movie. We paid homage to_ Blacktop _already when we shot the chase scene with the '55 Chevy, but when I was trying to figure out what movie they'd be watching at the movie theatre, so I just decided one day to try that clip from_ Two-Lane Blacktop _and the resonance it had was just perfect._

In terms of problems, there are a few. Indeed, we've covered one of them already – for many, the film will depend far too much on Redford, specifically the self-referential allusions to his career and legacy. If you're not a fan of his, you will get zero from this, absolutely nothing. Similarly, if you aren't familiar with at least some of his previous work, and his status in Hollywood, the whole thing will probably seem inconsequential. Another problem I have concerns Affleck. I know he's a celebrated actor and so forth, but for me, he plays himself in every single movie. There is virtually nothing to distinguish Hunt from Robert Ford in Andrew Dominik's _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford_ (2007) or Les Chandler from Kenneth Lonergan's _Manchester by the Sea_ (2016) or either of his performances in previous Lowery films. Every performance he gives, he plays a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, shuffling around, speaking in a low-key hang-dog voice, reluctant to make eye contact, shifting on his feet. The exact same thing in every film, with the exception of Scott Cooper's underrated _Out of the Furnace_ (2013), where he showed some fire.

Lowery also has a strange habit of introducing themes which seem to be setting something up, only to completely abandon them without any kind of engagement. This is most obvious in relation to Hunt's inter-racial marriage and their two mixed-race children. This is a fictional element added by Lowery, so one assumes there was some thought behind it. But this is Texas in 1981; there wouldn't have been a huge amount of mixed marriages. Yet Lowery seems to portray it as if it's the most normal thing in the world. Indeed, for the wife and children, life is fairly idyllic, with not a hint of any kind of societal disapproval. My point is why would you introduce a mixed-race marriage into this _milieu_ without commenting on it. Lowery obviously has little interest in exploring the social reality of race relations in Texas in the early 1980s, which is fair enough, but if that's the case, why bother raising the issue at all? I'm also mystified as to what we're supposed to make of the scene where one of Hunt's daughters writes a get-well card to Ronald Reagan after he was shot by John Hinckley Jr..

These issues aside, however, _The Old Man & the Gun_ is a fine film. As much about Robert Redford as it is Forrest Tucker, although that won't appeal to everyone, there is much to praise. Made in a key so low, it's practically subterranean, Lowery hinges everything on Redford's presence, and, for the most part, it works well. There's little in here to get overly excited about, but neither is there much to criticise. Yes, the film is somewhat insubstantial, and there's virtually nothing here beyond the Redford/Tucker character, but it's still beautifully made, and, honestly, there's nothing wrong with spending 93 minutes hanging out with Redford, whether he's playing Forrest Tucker or Robert Redford. Whether or not this is actually his last performance remains to be seen, but if it is, it's as fine a send-off as any Hollywood icon could hope for.,","bank,texas,fbi,based on a true story,heist,bank robbery,assumed identity,horse ranch,prison break,neo-noir,1980s,septuagenarian,american midwest,based on magazine, newspaper or article,nonviolent offender,finger gun,smile,",17,112,"David Lowery,"

I remember hearing about the Hatton Garden stuff when it happened and subsequently saw the television miniseries on ITV in 2019. That aforementioned show is very good, as is this 2018 film. It's a pretty simple film to make and act, hence why there are three films about this premise out there. However, that doesn't stop it being entertaining to see unfold.

The casting is obvious but, again, suits the production's needs perfectly. Michael Caine (Brian), Jim Broadbent (Terry), Charlie Cox (Basil), Michael Gambon (Billy) and Ray Winstone (Danny) all feature. Caine and Cox give the more memorable performances, but they all act well enough.

I like how the film portrays all of the criminals as criminals, none of them are good people and aren't shown as such. I also rate the humour, which is minor but nevertheless amusing in most parts.

- John Ajvide Lindqvist; ""Gräns""; from the short story collection _Pappersväggar_ [_Paper Walls_] (2006), republished in _Låt de gamla drömmarna dö_ [_Let the Old Dreams Die_] (2011)

Based on the short story of the same name by John Ajvide Lindqvist, written for the screen by Lindqvist, Ali Abbasi, and Isabella Eklöf, and directed by Abbasi, _Gräns_ [_Border_] is an intimate character drama, a study of loneliness, a romance, a police procedural, a body-horror, an investigation into what gives us our humanity, a psychological thriller, and a crime movie, set in a half-realist/half-fantastical _milieu_ which sees a woman who can smell guilt and commune with animals working as a customs agent at a small Swedish port. Because, obviously! However, no matter how fanciful the plot becomes, it remains grounded in an emotional realism which serves to normalise the outrageous events we're witnessing.

Also a socio-political allegory and a mythological fable, _Gräns_ is indefinable, switching fluidly from one genre to the next and one idea to the next, taking in such issues as the Other, the tribe, social ostracisation, social assimilation, and our tendency to rush to superficial judgements of that which we don't understand or which is different. Superbly acted and directed, there are, of course, a few problems; a subplot that feels disconnected from the main narrative, a ridiculous coincidence (the likes of which only ever happens in films), a twist you can see a mile away, and a pronounced moral ambiguity which is extremely difficult to parse. Nevertheless, this is unique filmmaking, which raises all manner of questions about how we act towards others, a crucial theme in a political arena which has seen an unprecedented growth in casual racism and xenophobic hatred.

Tina (a superb Eva Melander, acting under heavy prosthetics) is a customs officer with the ability to smell guilt, which makes her exceptionally good at her job. Suffering from deformities that give her a somewhat Neanderthal-like appearance, she lives an isolated life with her boyfriend Roland (Jörgen Thorsson), who is more interested in his pet Rottweilers that he is Tina. Unable to have sex because it hurts her too much, she and Roland sleep in separate beds. As the film begins, Tina intercepts a man (Viktor Åkerblom-Nilsson) carrying child pornography on his SIM card. It transpires that the police have been attempting to crack a prolific child porn ring for several months without any luck, and needing all the help she can get, the lead detective, Agneta (Ann Petrén), asks Tina to assist on the case. Meanwhile, Tina is shocked to encounter Vore (an extraordinarily physical performance by Eero Milonoff), who has the same deformities as herself. Although she smells something on him, she isn't sure what it is, and she lets him through customs. A few days later, he passes through again, this time volunteering to be searched. Her colleague, Robert (Andreas Kundler), conducts the body search, but quickly discovers that Vore has a vagina. When he tells Tina that Vore also has a large scar on his back, at the base of his spine, she is shocked, as she too has such a scar. She visits her father, Birger (Sten Ljunggren), who is suffering from early stage dementia, to ask about her scar, which he says she got from a fall when she was three. Intrigued by Vore, Tina meets up with him and offers to let him stay in her guest house, much to Roland's chagrin. Back on the trail of the child porn ring, Tina is able to identify the apartment in which the filming is taking place, and although they bust those in the apartment, they are unable to find anything on who may be trafficking the children. Meanwhile, back at Tina's house, she and Vore begin to grow closer, until a fierce thunderstorm brings them together in ways they never expected.

Given the fantastical elements of the plot, one of the most interesting things about _Gräns_ is how grounded in realism the aesthetic is. According to Abbasi, the

> _story is stylised, it's not realism; there are other elements, and it's elevated. So we thought instead of going with that, with stylised shots or framing that kind of signals something_ special _is going on, we tried to go the_ other _way. Instead of going with the magical, we went with the realism in our cinematic language, which I think was the right thing to do because it kind of anchors the realism. Because if it wasn't_ real_, you probably wouldn't care about Tina._

Abbasi has a point here - one of the strongest elements of the film is how emotionally engaging and relatable Tina's arc is; the events are fantastical in places, but the emotions are very much grounded in the everyday - loneliness, shyness, fear, love, disgust etc. The magic realist aesthetic allows the more unusual elements to exist without seeming (too) ridiculous, whilst also establishing that the world of the film is essentially the real world, just with some garnish added (in a strange way, it actually reminded me of Phil Alden Robinson's _Field of Dreams_ (1989), a film set in a realistic _milieu_ that also features, without commentary or explanation, ghosts, communication with the afterlife, and time travel).

Abbasi does set up a contrast, however, between the scenes in the forest which surrounds Tina's home and the rest of the locations. The forest is presented as a somewhat magical place from the start - it is where Tina is most comfortable (an early scene in which she chills with a gigantic moose is both illustrative of her psychology and extremely beautiful), where she goes when life starts to overwhelm her, often taking her shoes off so as to feel better connected to the natural world. Later, the forest is where Tina and Vore spend a lot of their time, where they give in to their attraction to one another (in what is easily the most bizarre sex scene outside a Lizzy Borden film you're likely to see all year), and where they explore their history. Whilst everything else is filmed with a cold palette dominated by grey and washed out light blues and greens, with relatively unattractive locations, the forest is presented very differently - the colours are richer and deeper; the design elements are more imaginative; the camera work is more fluid; even the sound design is different, heightening the crunch of feet on the forest floor, the scurrying of insects, the wind blowing through the trees, the crash of water at a small waterfall, suggesting the whole place is vibrant and alive, in stark contrast to the cold stolid concrete and steel world seen elsewhere.

Thematically, _Gräns_ functions as both a straightforward narrative about loneliness and morality _and_ as a political allegory about the Other, belonging, tribalism, hatred based on difference. The opening scene establishes Tina as the emotional lynchpin of the story, showing both her kindness and her attraction to the animal world, as she gently handles a bug, before carefully placing it back into the grass. This theme continues throughout the film - there's the aforementioned scene with the moose, a scene with a fox at Tina's window in the middle of the night, a scene in which she is rushing her neighbour to hospital to give birth and stops to let a family of deer cross the road. These scenes are shot by cinematographer Nadim Carlsen with a sense of wonder, and an almost ethereal quality that wouldn't have been out of place in something like Ridley Scott's _Legend_ (1985) or Rob Reiner's _The Princess Bride_ (1987). It's as far removed from the mundanity of the customs desk or the brutality of the child porn ring as you can imagine. This is also reflected in the sex scene, which Abbasi and Carlsen shoot in such a way as to imply that Tina and Vore attain an emotional and spiritual transcendence far removed from the commonplaceness of an orgasm. The fact that immediately afterwards, as they lie side by side in the forest, he tells her the history of their ""species"", solidifies the role the forest plays in the themes of the film, as their bond serves to deconstruct societal norms.

For all her closeness to animals, however, Tina is just as distant from humans; she has a good relationship with her father, with Robert, and with a young couple who live nearby (Tomas Åhnstrand and Josefin Neldén), but her relationship with Roland is dysfunctional at best, and she's desperately lonely, in a society that shuns based on appearance. Indeed, one of the most salient themes in the film is the question of how we treat the Other, people who don't fit into our definition of normal, or whom we don't understand. Vore himself is introduced as something of a rebel against social norms; whereas Tina is ashamed of and tries to hide her differences from everyone else, he is proud of and leans into his - seen most clearly at a buffet, where he takes all the smoked salmon, and then hungrily eats it with little concern for social etiquette (or buffet etiquette).

The film also touches on issues such as what gives us our humanity, suggesting that in a world populated by humans lacking in humanity (seen most clearly in the child pornographers), maybe Tina and Vore are the most human characters, or certainly the most humane. Tied to this is the notion of finding one's tribe, and what kind of sacrifices and subversions of one's moral code, if any, are acceptable in that search. However, the film is also interested in the audience's morality as well as that of the characters'. In short, it ends in an extremely morally ambiguous manner, and, to be honest, I found it very difficult to parse what Abbasi (or Lindqvist) is trying to say with it. I don't want to give any spoilers, but in essence, Tina is forced to make decisions based on her own morality, at the expense of her emotional instincts, whilst Vore must attempt to justify something horrific (actually several things horrific) by way of arguing that humans have always persecuted beings like them. I'm not sure if the film had a happy ending or not, and although I got most of the symbolism and the allegories and the socio-political critiques, I've rarely come out of a movie with such a pronounced case of ""what was the director trying to say with that?""

Elsewhere, the whole child porn subplot is troubling from a narrative point of view. For starters, it's not very convincing in its concrete details (for example, Tina is allowed sit in on a suspect interrogation), whilst the idea of a couple running a child porn ring from their apartment seems a little unlikely. Additionally, for the most part, the subplot serves to do little but detract from the main plot. I get that it's there to show us Tina's abilities and her moral code, but too much time is given to it without it being made to seem in any way urgent or important. And when it is finally integrated into the main narrative, it does so with a plot twist so telegraphed, if you don't see it coming, you've never seen a thriller before. Also, when we learn how the two plots connect, and when we backtrack in our mind to the start of the film, we find that the entire house of cards relied on a monumental coincidence which none of the characters could possibly have predicted, which cheapens both plot strands.

These missteps aside, _Gräns_ defies and subverts genre at every turn, remaining impossible to classify. Positing a message about how being different isn't that bad when you still have your morals and self-respect, it also suggests to those of us that consider ourselves normal, that we shouldn't be so quick to judge the Other, whether that Other is physically different, of a different ethnicity, a different religion etc. Exposing the layers upon which our society is built, the film is unafraid to suggest that hypocrisy and exclusion are major facets of Western civilisation. At a time when there are increasing calls for closed borders, increasingly irrational fear of the Other as represented by normal men and women who practice Islam, and increasingly jingoist and xenophobic hatred of anything not perfectly in line with established societal norms, the fact that Tina wants to integrate into normal society, but is essentially prevented from doing so, speaks volumes for our social ethos. The plot does go off the rails in the third act, and the morality of the _dénouement_ is a little questionable, but this is still a fine piece of work with a lot on its mind.,","sweden,pedophilia,supernatural,child pornography,border guard,based on short story,finland,smell,",11,46,"Ali Abbasi,"

The story this movie tells is similar to plots I have created in a few of the novels I have written. I think of them as ""slice of life"" tales. The story is taken up at a certain point and we follow along with her life with ups and downs until the script jumps out of her life. This is a subtle way of telling a story, perhaps too subtle if you are watching with friends or not in the mood for it. It is like that line from The Big Chill where the William Hurt character explains about art, that you have to let it flow over you.

Watching it closely reveals subtleties, such as when Gloria stops singing in her car, and then has to reclaim her joy. I will admit that sometimes the movie focuses on something too mundane, like her brushing her teeth, or that it leaves out too much, such as what happens to her at the Las Vegas hotel when she is on her own.

- Janna Levin; _Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space_ (2016)

Part murder-mystery, part esoteric cosmological rumination, part metaphysical neo-noir, Carol Morley's _Out of Blue_ is a complete shambles. That this is so gives me no pleasure at all, as I'm a big fan of both _Dreams of a Life_ (2011) and _The Falling_ (2014). _Dreams_, in particular, was a seismic gut-punch of a movie, beautifully made, and thoroughly sobering. I saw Morley do Q&As for both films at the Dublin International Film Festival, and I've always found her to be articulate and insightful, so I was really looking forward to _Out of Blue_. Loosely based on Martin Amis's 1997 novel _Night Train_, the film wears its influences very much on its sleeve, primarily Nicolas Roeg (whose son, Luc serves as a producer) and David Lynch. Obviously designed as a puzzle, the story only ever seems half-formed, as if we're seeing it through gauze. Mixing tones, themes, and styles, the film tries to be many things at once, but ultimately ends up being none of them; far too simplistic to be a fully realised examination of the nature of existence, far too predictable to be a whodunnit, far too clichéd to be a noir.

Set in New Orleans in an unspecified time period, the film begins with rising astrophysicist Jennifer Rockwell (Mamie Gummer), an expert on black holes and a proponent of the multiverse theory, giving a lecture on how humans are ""_made of stardust_"". The following morning, her body is found in the observatory in which she worked, shot three times. Homicide detective Mike Hoolihan (Patricia Clarkson), a recovering alcoholic who lives for the job, lands the case. As she starts investigating, she learns that Jennifer had become increasingly disturbed by the nature of her research into black holes. The daughter of Vietnam War veteran and wealthy businessman, Colonel Tom Rockwell (James Caan), and his wife, Miriam (Jacki Weaver), Jennifer had a fraught relationship with her parents, and many of her colleagues. Soon, Hoolihan has two main suspects; Jennifer's shifty and seemingly perpetually nervous boss, Professor Ian Strammi (Toby Jones) and her boyfriend/colleague, Duncan Reynolds (Jonathan Majors), who, upon finding out that Jennifer is dead, doesn't ask ""how"" or ""when"", but ""why"". The investigation will ultimately involve quantum mechanics, dark matter, string theory, Schrödinger's cat, and the double-slit experiment, as well as forcing Hoolihan to confront a childhood trauma she has repressed, of which the murder seems to be evoking flashbacks, and an unsolved serial killer case from the 1970s; the "".38 Killer"", who always killed women that looked a lot like Jennifer.

I haven't read the Amis novel on which the film is based, so I don't know if Morley has been successful in transplanting the tone to film, but irrespective of that, _Out of Blue_ attempts to connect the relative mundanity of human suffering to the vast unknowable mysteries of the universe. On the surface, this is quite similar to what Terrence Malick does in _The Tree of Life_ (2011). However, whereas Malick was essentially making the point that the birth of a galaxy is analogous with the birth of a child and that spirituality and science are not mutually exclusive, Morley sets our existence as a random and infinitesimal fragment in the impossible-to-conceive-of enormity of the universe.

Although ostensibly set in a realistic _milieu_, the film has an undercurrent of Lynchian weirdness that seems to place it just ever so slightly outside normality, with Morley intermixing her larger metaphysical concerns with a mundane whodunnit. To be fair, she does give us clues that the murder investigation is not where the audience should be focused; for example, when Hoolihan first arrives at the crime scene, as a detective is briefing her, the sound fades out and the camera moves away, suggesting the details of the crime are irrelevant. However, this doesn't change the fact that the predictable outcome of the investigation has virtually nothing whatsoever to do with black holes and the multiverse, with the reveal of the killer seemingly overriding the film's more esoteric themes, in a manner which severely undercuts the presentation of those themes. Audiences will be left asking such questions as why is there so much information on Jennifer's research; is it all just an elaborate MacGuffin; is it simply that Morley was unable to find a way to dramatize it, thereby integrating the two strands of the film? The idea is obviously that in searching for the killer, Hoolihan is essentially discovering herself, played out against the backdrop of infinity, but the film never addresses why we should care, as it doesn't actually say anything interesting or significant about the connection between humanity and the strange goings-on of space-time.

The quotidian nature of the whodunnit isn't helped by the fact that much of the acting is questionable, which seems unbelievable given the cast. Jackie Weaver appears to be in a completely different film to everyone else; James Caan is simply doing an imitation of John Huston in Roman Polański's _Chinatown_ (1974); Devyn A. Tyler as novice reporter Stella Honey, and Todd Mann and Brad Mann as Jennifer's creepy twin brothers never manage to escape the archetypal noir parameters of the characters they play; Yolanda Ross and Aaron Tveit, as Hoolihan's boss and colleague, respectively, are basically extras; even Patricia Clarkson struggles with breathing life into the material, although it's certainly unfortunate that the film is being released not so long after Karyn Kusama's infinitely superior _Destroyer_ (2018), in which Nicole Kidman gives a similar performance. Much of the problem, however, lies with Morley's script, rather than the actors. Essentially refusing to allow the audience any kind of emotional connection with the characters, Morley instead reduces the performances to shouting and clichés. There is one excellent scene in which Hoolihan gets drunk and takes off her clothes onstage at a strip club, and it's excellent because it's the one scene where Clarkson is allowed to engage with the audience at an emotional level, evoking both shock and pity.

Even the always-excellent Clint Mansell (_Requiem for a Dream_; _Black Swan_; _Filth_) is off his game, with his score failing to provide much in the way of texture or nuance, and occasionally seeming to actively work against what we're seeing. On the other hand, the cinematography by Conrad W. Hall (_Panic Room_; _Olympus Has Fallen_) is excellent, flattening New Orleans in the background, and essentially creating an oppressive and generic geographical location that could be anywhere and is always just out of reach, something which works in tandem with Hoolihan's repressed memories. Hall also does some solid work during the flashbacks to Hoolihan's childhood.

With the identity of the killer proving so banal (and just so predictable), the film essentially tasks its metaphysical component with doing all the heavy lifting, and this certainly does seem to be Morley's main concern. However, despite creating a dream-like narrative, always receding from the viewer, Morley can't cut loose of the shackles of genre, with the film's last act falling back on melodrama and unlikely coincidences. Ultimately, we're left with a film where nothing emerges fully formed. If it's really about Hoolihan's existential discovery of self, why is psychological nuance utterly absent? If it's a murder mystery, why is it so predictable and trite? If it's an esoteric rumination about eternity and the universe, why are so many of the necessary components presented in such a simplistic manner? Morley's themes and tones end up tripping over and undermining one another, as she singularly fails to integrate the metaphysical concepts with the murder plot. All in all, it's a misfire for a heretofore promising director.,Near as I can figure just about everybody hates this movie. Clearly expectations based on the novel were not met. I almost feel badly about not hating it. Oh well.

I found the complex and subtle plot line to be intriguing, and I was therefore too caught up in the evocative camera work and the atmospheric soundtrack to count the mistakes and perceived lapses in judgment that others found. Yes, I could have done without the little bits of film clips they threw in repeatedly: the marble or whatever it was rolling on the floor, the red scarf, and so on. There was no explanation that I could see and perhaps deserved to be on the cutting room floor, so to speak. And the ending was a bit too ambiguous for me, which probably was what they were aiming for, so congratulations to them on that front.

The question of suicide vs. homicide reminds me of when I took philosophy classes in college and noticed how a few leading philosophers in the early days of science committed suicide, whether because they were addressing questions no one had thought about before, or uncovering uncomfortable answers, or some other emotional response to the deep investigation into the human condition. And I wonder, do physicists ride the same sort of emotional roller coaster as they delve closer to answers to the big questions of where the universe came from, or indeed, are there multiple universes?

So anyway, I found Out of Blue to be entertaining, intriguing and thought provoking with a subject matter you rarely see explored in theatrical films, so I forgave its cinematic transgressions in other areas.,","based on novel or book,new orleans, usa,murder investigation,",17,67,"Carol Morley,"

_Loro_ [_Them_], the latest film from Italian _auteur_ Paolo Sorrentino, is what can only be described as very, very Sorrentino, insofar as it's a pure distillation of his overriding thematic concerns and an inclusive anthology-like compendium of his stylistic tendencies. By way of comparison, think of _Terrence Malick_'s _To the Wonder_ (2012), _Knight of Cups_ (2015), and _Song to Song_ (2017), in which he all-but-abandons plot and character arcs in deference to emotional beats, esoteric voiceover, and metaphysical tone; think of David Lynch's _Mulholland Drive_ (2001), _Inland Empire_ (2006) and _Twin Peaks: The Return_ (2017), his most sustained expressions of cinematic surrealism and fractured identity since _Eraserhead_ (1977); or, in a very different sense, think of Michael Mann's _Miami Vice_ (2006), with its jargon-heavy dialogue and thematic focus on obsessive (male) professionalism, coupled with Mann's continued experimentation with digital photography and expressive _mise en scène_. One thing these films all have in common is that they unapologetically establish very early on they are playing by their own rules, and if you don't buy in pretty quickly, you won't buy in at all.

So too _Loro_; this is Sorrentino at his most Sorrentino-like. Very much a thematic companion piece to _Il divo_ (2008), his examination of seven-time Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, whilst stylistically similar to the Oscar-winning masterpiece _La grande bellezza_ (2013), _Loro_ is more interested in extravagant hedonism and Dionysian excess than the former and more bitingly satirical than the latter. Visually stunning, with a towering central performance from Toni Servillo (working with Sorrentino for the sixth time), some will criticise the film as all style, no substance; some will decry the lack of a strong forward-moving plot; some will take issue with the fact that Sorrentino seems reluctant to condemn Berlusconi outright; some will argue that in attempting to satirise the commodification of the female body, Sorrentino simply reproduces such commodification, as well as legitimising the concomitant male gaze; some will find it too glossy and unrealistic; some will find it vulgar; some will find it sordid; some will regard the aping of Fellini as too on the nose. And there's validity in each position, to one degree or another. In other words, it's very, very Sorrentino!

Written with his regular writing partner Umberto Contarello, _Loro_ tells the ""partly fictionalised"" story of Silvio Berlusconi (Servillo) from just after the April 2006 general election (which saw _L'Unione_, the centre-left coalition led by Romano Prodi, narrowly defeat _Casa delle Libertà_, the centre-right coalition led by Berlusconi) and concluding with the April 2009 L'Aquila earthquake and Berlusconi's return to power. As the film begins, we're introduced to Sergio Morra (Riccardo Scamarcio), a pimp from Taranto. Hoping to ingratiate himself with Berlusconi, Morra heads to Sardinia, and rents a villa bordering Berlusconi's summer residence. Populating it with his escorts, who he encourages to party as much and as publicly as possible, he sits back and waits, knowing Berlusconi won't be able to stay away from so many scantily clad women for long. However, unbeknownst to Morra, Berlusconi's attention is elsewhere. Finding himself in a political position to which he is unaccustomed (leader of the opposition), he is at something of a loss as to how to fill his day. On a more personal level, his marriage to Veronica Lario (Elena Sofia Ricci) is breaking down, despite his best efforts to salvage the relationship. Meanwhile, his old friend, Ennio Doris (also Servillo), points out that due to how tight the 2006 election was (_L'Unione_ took the _Camera dei deputati_ by a margin of .1%), if Berlusconi could persuade six sitting senators to switch to the opposition, Prodi's government would collapse. Meanwhile, Veronica heads to Cambodia, leaving Berlusconi unsupervised at home, and by now he's very aware of who is living next door.

A controversial film in Italy from the moment of its announcement, Sorrentino was unable to secure funding from his usual financier, Medusa Film, which is co-owned by Berlusconi. Released in Italy in two parts, _Loro 1_ (104 minutes) and _Loro 2_ (100 minutes), the film was released internationally as one piece, running 145 minutes.

More formally inventive than any of Sorrentino's previous work, the visual structure of _Loro_ is not entirely dissimilar to that employed by Adam McKay in _The Big Short_ (2015) and _Vice_ (2018), with the cast even breaking into a full musical number at one point. And, as will come as a shock to precisely no one, _Loro_ looks absolutely amazing. There's the gorgeous and vibrant cinematography by Sorrentino regular Luca Bigazzi, rendering Sardinia as a lazy, sun-kissed nirvana bathed in the verdant green of the foliage and the rich blue of the ocean and sky, with the colours in general so vibrant as to make Luca Guadagnino's _Call Me by Your Name_ (2017) seem practically black and white in comparison. The richness of the film's visual aesthetic is helped immeasurably by the luxurious and gaudy production design by Stefania Cella (_What Just Happened?_; _Downsizing_; _White Boy Rick_), the decadent and seductive wardrobe by Carlo Poggioli (_Cold Mountain_; _Van Helsing_; _Divergent_), and the makeup by Maurizio Silvi (_Moulin Rouge!_; _Hannibal Rising_; _Zoolander 2_), hilariously recreating Berlusconi's waxen surgery-enhanced features and permatan, effectively turning Servillo into a human Ken doll.

Indeed, the film is almost _too_ beautiful. Sorrentino employs such lush, over-the-top beauty because he is satirising soulless elegance (and soulless tack); that which is aesthetically pleasing but metaphysically empty. By all-but drowning the audience in extraordinary, but ultimately meaningless, opulence, could he be accused of recreating and thus partially validating that which he is mocking? Yes, he could, although the counter-argument would be that he's too smart a filmmaker and too consummate an artist to 'accidentally' stumble into legitimising that which he is attempting to satirise. Take, for example, how he employs female nudity, of which there is a huge amount, almost all void of much in the way of narrative justification. On the surface, it's gratuitous nudity-for-nudity's sake. However, the lack of any meaningful rationale for showing such nudity is precisely the point; to show that the characters dispassionately view women as commodities. Every male in the film, and even some of the females (for example, Morra's business partner Tamara (Euridice Axen) and Kira (Kasia Smutniak), an acquaintance of Berlusconi's with whom Morra becomes infatuated) look at the escorts as objects whose bodies are for nothing beyond satisfying the lust of lascivious men and generating profit for their pimps. The sight of so many beautiful young women degrading themselves for lecherous old men leaves a nasty aftertaste, precisely as is intended.

The film opens with a bizarre scene depicting a lamb wandering into Berlusconi's villa. After a moment, the air conditioning turns on, and the lamb literally freezes. It's an absurdist scene right out of Franz Kafka, Luis Buñuel, or Roy Andersson, and it immediately sets the tone for the film, alerting the audience that this is not going to be a typical warts-and-all biopic; instead, it's going to be surreal and strange, slightly out of sync with the real world. Is Sorrentino saying that the only way one can parse a man such as Berlusconi is by placing him in a reality not quite our own, by fictionalising him and rendering him absurd? Perhaps. However, the film closes by intercutting the L'Aquila earthquake with his return to power; Italy is literally shaking to its core as he regains his authority, and there's little absurdity about this sequence.

One of the most interesting facets of the film is how relatively lenient Sorrentino is – Berlusconi is not exactly sympathetic, but neither is he what you would call a villain. In this sense, the film reminded me of Oliver Stone's _W._ (2008), in which Stone takes an unexpectedly even-handed approach in his depiction of the presidency of George W. Bush. Part of the reason Berlusconi comes across as not completely reprehensible is because of Toni Servillo. A performer of immense talent, Servillo is too intelligent and nuanced to allow any part lapse into caricature, and so, even when Berlusconi is at his most irredeemable, Servillo never allows us to forget there is a soul in there somewhere, however well-hidden it may be. A good example is a scene showing us Berlusconi at his most licentious, as he attempts to seduce Stella (Alice Pagani), a quiet and somewhat withdrawn young escort. As Servillo plays it, the scene is more pathetic than anything else; a sad old man unable to see how shameful his behaviour really is.

Servillo's Berlusconi remains always a bully, but he's also a man horrified by the fact that he's growing old, and his refusal to go gently into that good night is mixed with the occasional bout of regret. Servillo also lets us see just how much it genuinely hurts Berlusconi when his marriage breaks down, as he is still desperately in love with Veronica, despite the fact that his behaviour has led her to despise him. As he realises her mind is not for changing, he is able to get her to admit that she still loves him. However, she also says that he is not the same man she married, telling him, ""_you never reveal yourself. You are one uninterrupted performance._"" Tellingly, he isn't quite sure how to respond to this, and it's a legitimately painful moment. In this sense, the film essentially challenges the audience not to hate the man, despite his many reprehensible actions and characteristics. On a more superficial level, Servillo perfectly captures Berlusconi's ridiculous grin, his obsession with opulence, his disdain for etiquette, and his ability to spin anything to make himself look good, irrespective of the facts clearly showing that he's lying (and yes, it's supposed to remind us of a certain pathological liar currently living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW).

And although the film does feature Noemi Letizia (Pasqualina Sanna), it ends prior to the commencement of the alleged ""bunga bunga"" parties (supposedly mass orgies involving up to 20 women, who would perform African sexual rituals with Berlusconi). The first of these was not until February 2010, so there's also no Ruby Rubacuori, and the film addresses little that would later be cited in Berlusconi's 2013 trial for soliciting an underage prostitute.

Thematically, a major issue is acquisition; of capital, of property, of power, of influence, of anything. The driving force of so many of the characters (especially people like Morra, Tamara, and Kira) is simply ""more"". These are people who can literally never be satisfied. Indeed, on three separate occasions, a character says, ""_Having it all isn't enough_"". Another theme is the normalisation of decadence, a theme conveyed primarily by how Sorrentino shoots certain scenes. For example, we see cocaine being consumed so often that by the time we get to the last half-hour or so, we don't even register it anymore. This isn't the case of a filmmaker accidentally overexposing a trope. Rather, overexposure _is_ the trope; something like this should never be normalised, yet in this environment it most certainly is.

Speaking of decadence, the first half of the film is so full of sensationalist hedonism as to make the _milieu_ of _La grande bellezza_ look Puritan by comparison. Cocaine being snorted off escorts' bodies is a recurring motif, and naked or near-naked women are in the background so often you don't even see them after a while. In one brilliantly staged scene, as Morra and his escorts are walking through Rome, a garbage truck crashes and explodes, throwing its contents into the air before it rains down on the escorts. However, just as the garbage reaches them, the film cuts to a pool party in Morra's Sardinian villa, and instead of garbage falling from the sky, the escorts are instead in the middle of a shower of ecstasy tablets. Make of that metaphor what you will.

The _milieu_ is almost entirely devoid of morality; drugs are universal; sex is transactional; politicians are corrupt, petty, and venal egotists; innocence is something no one even remembers. Berlusconi's own attitude to holding public office is brilliantly dramatised in arguably the film's best scene. After deciding to return to politics, he tests himself to see whether he still has ""it."" Bearing in mind that he made his fortune and reputation successfully selling real estate in a hostile buyers' market, he randomly cold-calls a gloomy housewife and proceeds to sell her a luxury apartment that he readily admits hasn't even been built yet. It's a Servillo acting masterclass, and it's very funny, but it's also very telling - rather than brushing up on policy, or trying to clean his act up, this is how he prepares himself to attempt to topple the sitting government.

However, for all its strengths, _Loro_ is nowhere near the quality of Sorrentino's recent English-language output - _This Must Be The Place_ (2011), the horrifically underrated _Youth_ (2015), and the glorious _The Young Pope_ (2016), whilst it pales in comparison to its closest stylistic precursor, _La grande bellezza_ (for my money one of the top twenty films of the century, thus far). Sure, everything that makes a film a ""Sorrentino film"" is present and accounted for (as I said in the introduction, this is perhaps the most quintessential Sorrentino film yet) - there's the visual opulence, the hedonistic _milieu_, the undercurrent of corruption and greed, the casual sexuality. However, unlike, say, _La grande bellezza_ or _The Young Pope_, in _Loro_, the visual panache can often come across as an end unto itself, rather than serving the story and/or themes.

The biggest problem, however, is that structurally, the international cut is unable to escape the bifurcated narrative design of the original. Very much a film of two halves, the first half focuses on Morra and a group of politicians and hangers-on (the eponymous ""loro""), as they position themselves within Berlusconi's orbit, and the second focuses more tightly on Berlusconi himself (who doesn't actually appear on screen for almost an hour), especially his relationship with Veronica, and his attempts to once again become prime minister, with the film rarely leaving his Sardinian estate. And as you can probably imagine, the transition is not entirely smooth, especially insofar as entire subplots are abandoned without explication or resolution, and seemingly important characters fade into the background and often disappear (Morra himself features in only a couple of scenes in the second half), which does have the effect of making the whole thing feel a little scattershot at times.

That said, however, this is still Sorrentino, so no matter the problems, there's always going to be much to admire. He's a master _auteur_ who always has something fascinating to say, and here turning his attention to perhaps Italy's most notorious post-War politician, he gets plenty of inspired mileage out of the tawdry subject matter. Very much a chronicler of the darkness behind Italy's sparkle, Sorrentino suggests that Berlusconi, and men like him, are driven by vanity and a desire for power as its own reward. Yes, the storyline is a little slack, and, yes, it somewhat unexpectedly finds humanity in the man, and yes, it's Sorrentino's weakest film for a while. But it's also a Sorrentino film. And for that, if nothing else, it's worth a look.,",,116,11,"Paolo Sorrentino,"

Wonderful performances can't save the poor pacing and a confusing narrative structure. The overly ambitious script tries to portray too vast a period, and suffers from a pressured pace and perplexing timelines. It’s not exactly Carlos Acosta's life through dance, but it does showcase his talent magnificently, whilst also acting as a tribute to those who helped him get to where he is today. An intriguing yet cursory glance at a great artist.

Twelve personalities. The nightmare begins.,The Basement,False,4.4,31,"Horror,","The Conley Company,",,"en,","US,",1,"The Basement"" kicks off this basic horror premise with familiar fashion. An abduction and torture porn party favors. There is a quick but impressive set up scene that hints to the horrors in store, it tickles the horror bone and almost champions the idea that this is gonna be a nice, indie gem. Almost. 

Conley and Ives don't offer anything that hasn't been scene or written before, but they do show an effort in creating a story with continuity and depth. The production and cinematography is spot on,  edging toward perfect. The characters are standard constructs, common to most movies in this aubgenre, the notable standouts here are both Jackson Davis and Cayleb Long,  who give exceptional performances.

The acting at times falters somewhat, a few of Gemini Killer's personalities fall a bit flat- for the most part Davis rocks the crap out of his role. Long has a bit weaker dialog and isn't as developed as Davis' character, but still it is good enough to make their scenes together captivating. The contrasting scenes with Barton are slightly cumbersome, her character is way too two-dimensional, still it is one of her better performances. 

Special effects are limited, but what we get is quality, and play on classic torture tropes. The really big gore scene slips to mediocre slightly but it is still a fun, visceral treat. The real horror I'd heavy psychological melodrama and intense drama that holds solid between the two male leads. The score amps up the atmosphere and is a plus. 

Overall ""The Basement"" is a good movie, one of the better indie torture/revenge horrors I have seen lately. It isn't original by a long shot and the twisted reveal at the end is one you see coming. Still it is worth checking out and the issues aren't enough to kill the entertainment value - even the choppy mansion scenes with Mischa Barton don't hurt ""The Basement"" too much.,","serial killer,cheating husband,torture,execution,held captive,capture,killer clown,kidnapped,",11,18,"Brian M.

- Paul Conroy

In an age when many people give huge credence to patently fake news, outrageous conspiracy theories, and social media memes purporting universal truths, what is the role of perhaps the last great stalwart of what H.L. Mencken once referred to as ""_the life of kings_"" – the investigative journalist? The Fourth Estate has taken a pounding in recent years, and one wonders what Edward R. Murrow would have made of it all, but one thing of which we can be certain is that he would have respected the hell out of _Sunday Times_ war correspondent Marie Colvin, the ostensible subject of writer/director Christopher Martin's excellent documentary, Under the Wire. Based on _Under the Wire: Marie Colvin's Final Assignment_ by Colvin's photographer, Paul Conroy, who is also the primary interviewee in the film, the documentary covers the assignment on which Colvin was killed – the February 2012 military offensive during the Siege of Homs in Syria. Featuring a mixture of talking-head interviews and footage shot on-the-ground, with a small amount of interspersed reconstruction, the documentary is a more personalised version of the types of news story we see on a regular basis – ""_a journalist was killed today in…_"" However, whilst thematically, the film is about both Colvin's indefatigable spirit and Conroy's deep respect for her, it's structured more like a thriller, complete with plot twists, heroism, sacrifice, and success against-the-odds.

Generally uninterested in the official versions of events, which she equated with propaganda and often outright lies, Colvin was instead primarily concerned with presenting the stories of those usually forgotten in conflicts, arguing that ""_being a war correspondent is about what people are going through_"". Believing passionately that ""_journalism can make a difference_"", her career exemplified this belief. For example, in September 1999, Colvin was reporting on the East Timorese independence referendum. When the majority of voters chose independence from Indonesia, the pro-Indonesian militia began a wave of violence in the capital city, Dili. As journalists fled the country, tens of thousands of civilian refugees left the city. However, around 1,500 made their way to the UN compound. Colvin was urged to get out of harm's way, but refused, and, along with two Dutch reporters, Irene Slegt and Minka Nijhuis, headed instead to the compound. After four days of the trio shaming the Indonesian government in the international press, the journalists, the UN staff, and the 1,500 civilians were allowed to leave safely. In December that same year, whilst covering the early months of the Second Chechen War, she was embedded in the mountains with Chechen rebels. Finding her extraction route cut off by Russian paratroopers, she instead escaped over a snow-swept 12,000 foot mountain into Georgia. Surviving eight days in the wilderness, braving chest-high snowdrifts, hunger, exposure, and altitude sickness, she was eventually rescued by a Georgian helicopter dispatched at the behest of her husband, Patrick Bishop, and _Sunday Times_ colleague, Jon Swain. In 2001, whilst reporting on the treatment of Tamil peasants during the Sri Lankan Civil War, her left eye was badly hurt when she was hit with shrapnel from an RPG. Despite the injury, which caused her to permanently lose the sight in her eye, she still managed to file copy before that day's deadline. In 2011, she conducted the first interview with Muammar Gaddafi since the commencement of the Arab Spring earlier that year. Essentially, Colvin was not someone who simply believed ""_journalism can make a difference_"", she was someone who made sure ""_journalism_ did _make a difference._""

Which brings us to _Under the Wire_. Having covered the Arab Spring in Libya, Colvin next headed to Syria, where civil uprisings had been taking place since March 2011, and armed insurgency had broken out in July. On February 3, 2012, in the city of Homs, which had been under governmental attack since May 2011, the Syrian Army launched an offensive focused on the rebel stronghold of Baba Amr. With the Bashar al-Assad government attempting to control the influx of journalists into the country, Colvin and Conroy were refused travel visas, and so, on February 13, they illegally crossed the Syrian/Lebanon border, heading to Baba Amr. Once there, they soon learned that Assad's claim that no civilians were in harm's way was a lie – over 28,000 civilians were trapped in the district. Based out of a ""media centre"" (basically, one of the few houses in the area which still had wi-fi), Colvin, Conroy, _TIME_'s William Daniels, and _Le Figaro_'s Edith Bouvier, and her photographer Rémi Ochlik, immediately began to file copy, as the city was shelled incessantly around them. As the shelling became more intense, and with rumours spreading of a ground assault, the _Sunday Times_' editor, Sean Ryan, told Colvin and Conroy to get out of the area. They did so, but the next day, when the ground assault never happened, feeling they had abandoned the people in the district, they both returned. On the evening of February 21, Colvin was interviewed live by CNN's Anderson Cooper, whom she told the shelling was the worst she had ever experienced, explaining

> _there's nowhere to run. The Syrian Army is holding the perimeter, and there's just far more ordinance being poured into the city, with no way of predicting where it's going to land._

The following morning, the media centre in which the reporters were based was shelled, with both Colvin and Ochlik killed, and Conroy and Bouvier seriously injured.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about the film is that the above summary only takes us to just after the half-way point. At this stage, I was thinking, ""okay, so I guess the rest is going to be obituary-type material"". However, that's not where it goes at all. With Colvin dead, the narrative shifts focus to Conroy, and the film basically turns into an escape thriller, as the wounded photographer seems to have little hope of making it out of the country alive (nor does the even more severely wounded Bouvier). Obviously both did, as they both give interviews in the film, but even though we know this, the fact that it doesn't dilute the heart-in-the-mouth experience of the second half of the narrative is a testament to Christopher Martin's craft and storytelling ability.

For example, the film opens with a purposely disorientating shot that appears to be inside a tunnel of some kind. We later learn that it is the 3km storm drain which Colvin and Conroy used to get into Syria. However, what's especially well-thought-out about this opening is that that storm-drain proves vitally important towards the end too. This is basic narrative foreshadowing, but it's relatively unusual to see it in a documentary. Similarly, the fact that everyone in the audience knows before the film even begins that Colvin dies adds an air of foreboding that, strangely enough, reminded me of Sean Penn's use of a similar(ish) technique in _The Pledge_ (2001). Also vital to this thriller structuring is the time the documentary takes to explain the Syrian Arab Red Crescent incident. No spoilers, but this sequence is one of the best parts of the film, providing perhaps the biggest twist in the story, and highlighting how one can find heroes (and villains) in the most unexpected of places.

_Under the Wire_ is not especially interested in contextualising the events it depicts (I've given more background on the conflict in the above couple of paragraphs than the film does), but that's because this isn't what the story is about; this is not an examination of the politics or morality of the Syrian Civil War. For example, although it explains that Homs was held by rebels, it never specifies who the rebels are or why they are fighting the government. Similarly, it never covers the theory, held by both the _Sunday Times_ and the French government, that Colvin and Ochlik's deaths were in fact executions – that the media centre was shelled on purpose to silence the reporters stationed there; nor does it examine the fact that after their deaths, the Syrian government tried to claim the explosion which killed them was actually a rebel bomb.

At the same time, this isn't a standard bio-doc – we don't get all the beats from Colvin's life, why she became a journalist, famous stories she'd written etc (there are brief references to the East Timorese and Sri Lankan incidents, but nothing else). In that sense, this is a very different animal than something like Brian Oakes's _Jim: The James Foley Story_ (2016), which focuses very much on Foley's bio. Having said that, however, the documentary does make sure to drive home how driven, and oftentimes difficult, Colvin could be (Conroy refers to her as ""_a one off_"" and Ryan says she was ""_the most important war correspondent of her generation_""). This is accomplished primarily by way of two stories – one in which a photographer assigned to her told his editor that she was scarier than the war they were covering, and another in which she refused to work with a photographer who identified as a metrosexual. She was a brilliant woman. No one said she was an easy woman.

Apart from the thriller structure and the streamlined, non-contextualised narrative, another aspect of the story which gets a lot of attention, and which is also very well done, is the issue of reporters losing their objectivity in situations like the one in Baba Amr. Early on, Conroy relates how, as journalists, they should never allow themselves to become partisan. However, as the narrative goes on, this objectivity goes out the window, and for good reason. How does one remain objective when reporting on Dr. Mohammad Mohammad, a surgeon operating without sterile equipment or anaesthetic because had he left the basement in which he was working so as to obtain supplies, he would have been shot by snipers? How does one remain objective when reporting the story of a child injured in the shelling, dying on a table because there is no equipment to perform the operation needed to save his life? Or when reporting that he was so badly disfigured that the elderly woman acting as a nurse didn't even recognise him as her own grandchild at first and subsequently had to stand by and watch him die in front of her. According to Conroy,

> _I felt rage and I knew that, for Marie, this was her story and she was going to go for it whatever the cost. She decided to do as many broadcasts as possible as a plea to the world._

In her final broadcast, Cooper asked Colvin why she was staying and how was she able to cover such incidents, to which she answered,

> _I feel very strongly that they should be shown. That's the reality. That little baby probably will move more people to think 'Why is no-one stopping this murder that is happening every day?' Every civilian house on this street has been hit. There are no military targets here; the Syrian army is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians._

Speaking retrospectively, Conroy relates, ""_it wasn't war, it was slaughter._"" This is not journalistic objectivity. Nor should it be. Conroy knows that, in an ideal world, they should remain always non-partisan, but he is equally as aware that this is impossible in the face of the indiscriminate slaughter of defenceless civilians, and neither he nor the documentary make any apologies for that.

Obviously, as the author of the book on which the film is based, Conroy anchors proceedings. Indeed, there are only a few additional interviewees (Bouvier, Ryan, Daniels, their Syrian translator Wa'el, and Colvin's colleague and friend Lindsey Hilsum). Passionate, funny, and full of nervous ticks, Conroy's talking-head material contrasts well with the terrifying footage he himself shot in Syria, and raises significant questions regarding why Assad has been allowed to remain in power, whilst also forcing the audience to consider our own attitude to the Syrian refugee crisis (try watching an elderly man and woman hobble away from the ruins of the home they have lived in all their lives, their few remaining possessions strapped to their backs, and remain detached as to the plight of these people). Conroy is also deeply emotional regarding his experiences, and one of the most moving parts of the documentary is when he views footage of a mass protest in Homs on the evening of February 22, with the people carrying banners and flags emblazoned with pictures of Colvin and Ochlik, alongside the words ""_We will not forget you_"". Conroy was unaware this had happened at the time, and had never seen footage of it before filming his interview. It's simply impossible not to be deeply moved by his reaction to the footage.

And that, in a nutshell, is why this is such a strong piece of work. Equal parts emotive, stimulating, anger-inducing, and thrilling, it's a story of bravery and professional dedication in the face of unimaginable horrors, of determined humanitarianism, and absolutely impossible-to-deter dedication to giving a voice to those who so often remain voiceless.,",,0,7,"Chris Martin,"

I’m now a fan. Nash is an irresistibly likeable subject, and she is a huge part of what makes the film so entertaining. This is a great doc that explores what it’s like to be a musician in the modern world.

This polished film tells the story of Nash, tackling the entire trajectory of her career. Starting from her first taste of superstardom at age 18 to a decade later when she is nearly homeless, the film offers an intimate look at the challenges, disappointments, failures, highs, and lows of an industry that chews up and spits out the very artists that are its lifeblood.

Nash soared to the top of the UK pop charts in 2007 with a platinum record, and struggled with the burdens of her newfound fame. After worldwide tours and international success, the outspoken and trusting musician was defrauded by her manager, dropped by her record label, and forced to take soul crushing odd jobs (like hawking comic book merchandise for an online geek shopping network). After she’s forced to sell off her clothes and move back home, Nash has a revelation and decides to take control of her life and career.

Goldstein’s affinity for her subject shines through, and her well structured film takes viewers on an inspirational journey of creative fearlessness. Nash uses her music as a form of self-therapy, an outlet to express life’s frustrations through her art. Her original lyrics reflect her real life, giving a personalized glimpse into an artist who thrives on creativity and receives joy from the act of performing.

It’s sad how the people she trusted took advantage of her trust and her talent, and the film addresses the highs and lows of, and the serious problems in, the music industry. As Nash herself says, being in the industry “has almost killed me, but I’m not going to die for the sake of being a f’ing pop star.”

It’s a discouraging career choice to be in a business “where the bad guy succeeds most of the time,” but the film hits the high notes when Nash decides to make her fans her record label and crowd fund an album through a Kickstarter campaign. She’s following her heart and making the music she wants on her own terms, taking big steps to turn her life around. During this time, Nash also decided to add acting to her resume and auditioned for the Netflix series “GLOW,” where she’s cast as Rhonda.

The music industry is a tough place for women, but Nash’s story ends on a happy note. The teenager who started her career on MySpace has successfully reinvented herself, is speaking out about the need for protection for artists, and is looking towards a bright future. This is a rewarding documentary about a person that you’ll root for from the start, and it’s hard to watch it and not instantly become a fan.,",,1,1,"Amy Goldstein,"

On the evening of December 6, 2014, in the small town of Courtland, Mississippi (population just over 500), the fire department responded to reports of a burning car on a quiet rural road. As they fought the flames, one of them saw someone approaching from the nearby woods; a young girl, wearing only her panties, her entire body burnt beyond recognition, her hair singed away to nothing. Her name was Jessica Chambers (19) and she had been inside the car when it was doused in accelerant and set on fire. Incredibly, despite having third-degree burns to 93% of her body, Jessica was lucid enough to tell multiple first-responders that ""Eric"" had set her on fire. But who was Eric? Why did he do this? Why would anyone kill someone in this manner? Jessica died in the early morning hours of December 7, but her death was only the prologue to a story which would rip a town apart, destroy two families, lead to two trials, expose both investigative and prosecutorial ineptitude, and highlight a dark and dangerous side of social media. And it's a story which is unresolved even now, almost six years later.

Inspired by Katie J.M. Baker's June 2015 _BuzzFeed_ article, ""Troll Detective"" and directed by celebrated documentarian Joe Berlinger (_Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills_; _Metallica: Some Kind of Monster_; _Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger_), _Unspeakable Crime: The Killing of Jessica Chambers_ aired on Oxygen in North America and Sky Crime in the UK and Ireland. Originally a five-part series (the feature-length first episode was split in two for international markets), an additional episode was hastily added when the story took an unexpected turn in the middle of the broadcast. Despite its title, however, _Unspeakable Crime_ isn't really a deep dive into why Jessica was killed or who may have done it. Rather, it's a courtroom drama, following the trial of the man who law enforcement believes lit the match – Quinton Tellis (26 at the time). It's a solid enough overview of the case, although some of the more interesting revelations are found, strangely enough, only in the accompanying podcast of the same name. A tad repetitive and not especially interesting from an aesthetic point of view, the show nevertheless does a good job of laying out the facts and illustrating just how many lives this horrific crime impacted, and how profoundly it impacted them.

A former cheerleader, Jessica had had a very close relationship with her family until her brother Allen was killed in a road accident in 2012. After his death, Jessica lost interest in cheerleading and school in general, started smoking and selling weed, and became associated with several local gang members (although she herself was never in a gang). Early in 2014, Jessica spent time at Leah House, a ""restoration home for women"", and according to her mother Lisa Daugherty, she had committed to turning her life around and pursuing her dream of becoming a nurse.

Up to a point, Jessica's movements on December 6 are known. She spent the morning with her friend Kesha Meyer and Quinton Tellis, whom she had only recently met, and with whom she may or may not have had a sexual relationship. Tellis had only been out of county jail a few months, having served time for simple assault, possession of narcotics, and resisting arrest. After Tellis dropped her home on December 6, Jessica slept for a few hours, before receiving a text message later that afternoon. Telling her mother she was going to get something to eat, she left the house around 17:00. About a half-hour later, surveillance footage showed her at a local convenient store. Her cell phone data then shows she travelled to the next town over, Batesville, at around 18:00, returning to Courtland at 18:30. At 18:45, she called Lisa and said she'd be home soon. It remains unknown exactly what happened from this point forward, as her phone went dark, and she would not be seen again until she approached firefighters at around 20:15.

As she was being treated by first-responders, Jessica repeatedly said that someone named either ""Eric"" or ""Derrick"" had set her on fire. However, she gave no surname and the only additional information she provided was that the man was black. No one in her phone was named Eric or Derrick, and none of her family or friends knew of anyone by that name. With this in mind, law enforcement looked at every African-American named Eric or Derrick in Panola County, with none proving a viable suspect. As they knew he was with her on the day she died, they also questioned Tellis, but at the time, he wasn't under any suspicion (and he also passed a polygraph). 

Fast-forward to 2015, at which point police are still without a suspect, with each investigative avenue leading nowhere. It was only when they went back over the cellphone data that they saw a connection to Tellis they'd missed in 2014 – his phone data placed him in the same immediate area as Jessica in the hours leading up to her death, and his phone went dark for the same period as hers, from around 18:45 until around 20:15. When they attempted to locate Tellis, police learned he was in prison in Louisiana. Earlier in 2015, he had been convicted of using a stolen debit card and sentenced to ten years for fraud. What makes the situation more interesting, however, is that the card belonged to Meing-Chen Hsiao, a Taiwanese student at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, who was tortured and killed just days prior to Tellis using her card (which he asserts he purchased from a street-level drug dealer). CCTV footage shows Hsiao and Tellis together at a Wal-Mart the day before she was believed to have been killed, and in the days leading up to her death, Tellis was seen coming and going from her apartment multiple times (he would be indicted for her murder in May 2019).

When police questioned Tellis about his movements on the day of Jessica's death, he changed his story several times. Initially, he claimed not to have seen her after dropping her off at her house around 11:00, saying he was in Batesville with a friend at the time Jessica's car was set on fire. This alibi proved false, however, as the friend was actually in Nashville at that time, and Tellis wasn't with him. Additionally, security camera footage from the store that Jessica visited at 17:30 showed Tellis there at the same time and then showed him returning to the store at 20:26, roughly ten minutes after firefighters had arrived at the scene of the fire. In this later footage, Tellis is wearing different clothes than in the earlier footage. Confronted with this, Tellis changed his story again, saying that he and Jessica went to Batesville to get something to eat, and upon arriving back in Courtland, they parked in his driveway until 19:00, at which point she drove away. Investigators also discovered that in the hours immediately after her death, Tellis had deleted all communication with Jessica from his phone, even going so far as to remove her from his phonebook entirely.

Investigators believe that as Jessica and Tellis sat in her car in his driveway, he tried to have sex with her and she resisted (several times in the days before her death, he had contacted her asking for sex, but she had turned him down each time). They posit that he choked her in a rage, rendering her unconscious (incredibly, Jessica was never examined for signs of sexual assault so it's unknown whether she was raped before her death). Believing that he had killed her, Tellis drove her car to where it would later be found and then ran to his sister's nearby home (the keys to Jessica's car were found on the road between the crime scene and the house). He borrowed his sister's car, drove back to his own home, got a can of gasoline, drove back to the car, set it on fire with Jessica inside (still unaware she was alive), returned to his sister's, changed clothes, and was then seen on CCTV at 20:26. It's a very tight timeline, with some arguing he wouldn't have been able to do everything in the time available, whilst others argue it's just about possible. In February 2016, Tellis was indicted on a capital murder charge, with his trial beginning in October 2017, which is roughly where the series begins.

Hosted by Beth Karas, _Unspeakable Crime_ features an impressive cross-section of people involved with the case, giving us multiple perspectives. Interviewees including Lisa Daugherty (Jessica's mother), Ben Chambers (her father), Amanda Prince and Ashley Chambers Sipes (her sisters), Debbie Chambers (her stepmother), Rebecca Tellis (Tellis's mother), Laqunta Tellis and Shaneeka Williams (his sisters), Darla Palmer and Alton E. Peterson (his defence team), John Champion (DA, Panola County), Jay Hale (Asst. DA), Maj. Barry Thompson (lead investigator, Panola County Sheriff's Department), Lt. Edward Dickson (Thompson's second-in-command), Sheriff Dennis Darby and Chief Deputy Chris Franklin (Panola County), Lt. Jimmy Anthony (Vice President, Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators), Melissa Meek-Phelps (Circuit Clerk, Panola County), Eddie Edison (volunteer firefighter and the first on the scene of the crime), Neal Johnson (Asst. DA (Ret.), Monroe County), Chief Deputy Otis Griffin (Coahoma County), Benniea Felder (juror), Katie J.M. Baker (_BuzzFeed_), Janice Broach (WMC-TV), Therese Apel (_The Clarion Ledger_), Ashley Mott (_Monroe News-Star_), John Howell (_The Panolian_), Melissa Jones (LawNewz), Demarcio Coleman (former gang member and drug dealer), Professor Greg Hampikian (DNA expert and Founder/Director of the Idaho Innocence Project), Ben Levitan (telecommunications expert), George 'Boone' Mister (Jessica's friend, who was targeted by online sleuths), Charlotte Wilkerson (another friend, who was also targeted), and multiple Courtland residents, some of whom believe Tellis to be innocent, whilst others are convinced of his guilt.

One of the show's main themes is the pernicious effects of social media. Within days of her death, multiple Justice for Jessica and Jessica's Revenge groups had appeared on Facebook. Without a shred of evidence, some amateur sleuths suggested Ben had killed her because he disapproved of miscegenation, and at the time of her death, Jessica was dating an imprisoned African-American, Travis Sanford. Others focused their ire on Lisa's perceived lack of parenting skills. When Tellis was accused of the crime, his family became the target for hatred and harassment. Of course, as Baker points out, none of these armchair detectives actually knew any of the people involved, had access to any of the case files or evidence, or had ever visited Courtland. But that didn't stop them attacking the Chambers family, abusing the Tellis family, and even turning on Jessica herself when it emerged she smoked and sold weed, with some speculating that her death may have been gang-related. In an especially lucid example of the toxicity of online herd mentality, Ali Alsanai, the clerk at the store where Jessica was last seen, was forced to leave Panola County when he received death threats after right-wing commentators began to accuse him of the murder. Their evidence? He's of Middle-Eastern descent.

As this might suggest, aside from social media-related issues, the other big theme is race. One of the first comments in the first episode is that Tellis's trial has triggered a pseudo-race war in Courtland, with most blacks believing him innocent and most whites believing him guilty. With this in mind, there are many references to an ominous feeling in the air, as groups protesting Tellis's innocence and groups asserting his guilt gather at the courthouse in Batesville. This feeling only gets stronger as the trial approaches its conclusion (on the day of the verdict, police formed a barrier at the front of the court, just in case).

Within the trial, the show's main focus is the same thing that Tellis's defence team focused on – the fact that Jessica said that ""Eric"" or ""Derrick"" had set her on fire. This was _the_ major hurdle that the prosecution had to try to overcome; by suggesting that Tellis was the murderer, it meant that they had to discount the testimony of at least eight first-responders, all of whom heard her say ""Eric"" or ""Derrick"". To this end, they called to the stand Dr. William Hickerson, a plastic surgeon specialising in burns, and Carolyn Higdon, Professor of Communication Sciences and Disorders at the University of Mississippi. Both testified that Jessica would have found it difficult to impossible to say anything clearly, due to her injuries, and both outright reject the notion that she said ""Eric"" or ""Derrick"". Prosecutors instead suggest that the proliferation of the name amongst first-responders was a kind of inverted Chinese whisper – one first-responder thought they heard something that sounded like ""Eric"", and suddenly eight people claimed to have heard it. As Karas points out, however, when eight of your own witnesses testify that a murder victim gave up the name of her killer, and it isn't the name of the guy on trial, you've got a serious obstacle to overcome.

With that in mind, the show spends a lot of time illustrating the often gaping holes in the prosecution's case and the inadequacies of the police investigation. For example, Lt. Dickson is shown having a truly bizarre exchange with Peterson on the witness stand – when Peterson asks him where he was when he got the call about the fire, he says he was at home in Sardis, a town about 18 miles north of Courtland. However, when Peterson asks him how long it took him to get to Courtland, he says that not only does he not know how many miles the journey is, he also says he has no idea how long the drive takes (""_I've never clocked myself going to work_""). As an incredulous Ben says, this is a drive that Dickson has made twice a day for about 22 years, pointing out that his own seven-year-old daughter (Jessica's half-sister) would be able to tell you how long it takes her to get to school. The show is also critical of how the police processed the crime scene, arguing that a larger area should have been roped off (the actual crime scene was the car, nothing outside it), that dogs should have been used to search for ignitable liquids, that fire-trained CSI officers should have been called in, that the car should have been left at the scene for longer (it was moved to the police lot the night of December 6), that the surrounding woods should have been searched either that night or at first light (they weren't searched until the following week), and that Jessica should have been examined for signs of sexual assault.

A big area of criticism concerns DNA found on Jessica's car keys. Although the prosecution says on multiple occasions that Tellis's DNA was on the keys, during cross-examination, their own DNA expert, Catherine Rogers, explains that this isn't entirely accurate. In actuality, the DNA of four men was found on the keys, and Rogers couldn't exclude the possibility that some of the DNA was Tellis's. Which is, of course, a very different thing than saying his DNA is on them. The podcast goes into this in a lot more detail than the show, but, in essence, Hampikian explains that Rogers used a Y-STR test, which didn't exclude Tellis, when an autosomal STR test (which did) should have been presented in court;

> _in this case, you had a general inclusion with the Y-STR, kind of like a first initial, but then when you drill down with the very precise autosomal STR test, you have what is essentially a social security number. That's why we prefer that autosomal STR test. If a suspect is included or cannot be excluded from a mixture of Y-chromosomes and a Y-STR test, but they are excluded by an autosomal STR test, they're excluded, period. No further testing is needed. It's disingenuous, to say the least, to keep someone in an inclusion when you have a more precise test that absolutely excludes them. So why isn't that information in the report? I don't understand it. The autosomal test is the more precise test, end of story. You don't even talk about your general screening test that includes potentially millions of people. You only should talk about the more precise test. It's kind of like, you might think you're pregnant, but you're not going to tell your friends if you've taken a pregnancy test that says you're not pregnant; you're not going to continue to tell them, ""I think I'm pregnant"". When you have better information, you defer to the better information, and in this case, the better information is the autosomal STR exclusion, not the DNA mixture inclusion – in this case, Tellis was excluded by the autosomal test, a point which wasn't included in the written report._

Significant and thought-provoking stuff.

The other major area critiqued by the show is the cellphone data that the prosecution argued proves Tellis and Jessica were in the same place at the same time right before she was set on fire. In short, it doesn't. At all. The investigation into the cellphone data was led by Paul Rowlett, an Intelligence Specialist with the Department of Justice. For Jessica's phone, he looked at records for the Range to Tower (RTT), a Verizon-exclusive technology, which can be used to pinpoint a phone when it pings the nearest cell tower. Rowlett says that RTT records prove Jessica was at Tellis house until about 19:30. However, Tellis's phone was AT&T, who use a Network Event Location System (NELOS), which gives the direction from which a phone is pinging a tower, but not the distance, thus making it impossible for the data to prove Tellis and Jessica were together. According to Levitan,

> _the state has a theory and they've taken the cellphone evidence, not looking at it objectively, and manipulated it in a manner to fit the theory. The cell tower that she's connected to when she makes the call to her mother does not cover Tellis's house, does not cover that area whatsoever. When Jessica made this phone call, she was connected to a cell tower that was in Pope, which is three to four miles south of Quinton's home. As such, that call excludes her from being at Tellis's house at that time_ [...] _if law enforcement had come to me, and said ""can you analyse the cell phone data and tell us were these guys together"", I would have said ""you're shifting the data to make the evidence for your theory. This is_ not _your guy""_ [...] _In some cases, they may have been in an overlapping area, but for the most part, they were not together, period. Based on science, based on the cellphone data we objectively looked at, what Rowlett said is not true. I cannot put Quinton Tellis in an area smaller than 14 square miles. That's what the data shows. That it was presented to the jury as ""irrefutable evidence"" that Tellis was with Jessica is completely false._

So, much like the DNA, not only does the evidence not confirm Tellis's guilt, it actually suggests his innocence. Levitan also discovered that during the hour when the prosecution claim both Tellis and Jessica's phones were dark, Tellis actually sent three texts, but he did so using an online server rather than via his phone. Strangely, however, Tellis defence team don't call a single witness, so there's no one to refute or even challenge Rogers and Rowlett's testimonies. This is something the show skims by, disappointingly letting Palmer and Peterson off the hook, which is strange when one considers the length the show goes to probe and present the evidence.

The show also looks at some interesting side-issues, albeit fairly superficially. For example, Tellis told police that a registered sex-offender named Derrick Holmes was stalking Jessica. He was ruled out by investigators as a possible suspect, but the reason they discounted him leaves Karas somewhat aghast – he was apparently at home rubbing his mother's feet at the time the car was set on fire, with seemingly little to back this up, other than the word of his mother and some additional family members. Another issue is that the week she was killed, Jessica had told Lisa, ""_these bitches think I'm snitching, but I'm not_"", although she refused to elaborate on who ""these bitches"" were. Ben was a mechanic with the local police department, and according to Jessica, because of that connection to law enforcement, she had been pegged a rat. However, the show never really goes anywhere with this fascinating line of enquiry. A third issue is that of a mysterious black male who was present at the crime scene as firefighters fought the blaze, even speaking to one of them (who he totally weirded out). According to witnesses, he was acting very strangely and seemed fascinated with the fire. The show states that this man was identified and cleared of any involvement, but it gives us no further information.

Some other criticisms I'd have would include how aesthetically bland the show is and a tendency towards repetition, especially from episode to episode, as each episode tends to repeat material from the previous episode. Additionally, too much valuable information is covered exclusively in the podcast.

There are so many incredible foreign language films on offer, I couldn’t quite find the magic and brilliance that allowed ‘The Goalkeeper’ the make the shortlist. There’s too much plot to make this a character piece, and too much character to make it plot-driven. Nor is it balanced. This film only has two acts, needing a better middle to really hook the audience. And when the grim second half comes along, it’s difficult to follow it through and be okay with what Patiño has presented. I can see what he was going for, but it just needed more care to get there.
