Pictures,DC Films,The Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit (CPTC),",,"en,","GB,CA,US,",26,"The long anticipated “Justice League” has finally arrived finally combining the biggest stars of the DC universe into one film. The proposed film has faced many obstacles on the way to the big screen ranging from script issues, massive reshoots and a change of Director for said reshoots due to a family tragedy that Director Zack Snyder suffered.

The film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion.  

The death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet after he collects the three needed artifacts that his plan requires.

In a race against time, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to battle to save the planet. Naturally they battle amongst themselves as well as their massing enemies but ultimately decide on a dangerous plan that can tip the odds in their favor and save the day.

The action in the film is good but it often plays out like a video game. With so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds, the movie looked like a video game. There were numerous scenes that looked like they were lifted from Injustice and Injustice 2 that I mused to myself that someone must have used their Power Up for the shot.

Affleck and Gadot are good and work well with one another, but there are some serious casting issues with the film. The biggest for me was Ezra Miller as The Flash. I did not like his effeminate, nerdy, socially awkward, and neurotic and at times cowardly take on the character. This is not the Barry Allen I grew up reading in comics or the one that has been portrayed twice in a much better fashion on television. His comic relief status grew old fast and his character really offered little to the film.

It has been well-documented that Joss Whedon not only handled the rewrites for the film but took over directing duties to complete the film. You can see elements of his humor scattered throughout and the film does move along at a steady pace without dragging.

The biggest issue is that so many of the characters are just stiff and one-dimensional. They really are not overly interesting so it is hard to really connect with them and the tasks they are facing. Unlike Marvel who have excelled with dysfunctional groups who fight amongst themselves as well as the forces of evil, this group seems to be going through the paces rather than being fully engaged with the task at hand and each other.

In the end “Justice League” is better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road.  As it is, it is flawed entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues.

3 stars out of 5,An enjoyable superhero team movie. It's really being unfairly trashed by the critics. It's not up to the excellence of this summer's Wonder Woman film, but it's quite fun to watch. What made this film better than some of the other previous DCEU films is that it has a sense of humor. Previous films were rightfully criticized for being too dark and humorless. Gal Gadot is the stand out as Wonder Woman. This film did a better job in its portrayal with Superman. In Man of Steel, he battled Zod, which resulted in massive human casualties, without a care, which does not fit the character at all. That made me mad as a Superman fan. Here, he shows concern for innocent civilians, flying away with an entire building of people to make sure they would not be harmed in the battle against the villain. The one weak spot is the Big Bad, Steppenwolf. He's a rather fake looking CGI creation that lacks depth. But he's only the precursor to the REAL villain--Darkseid. The two end credit scenes are entertaining. The last one teasing the formation of the Legion of Doom/ Injustice League is particularly intriguing.,though thanks to bad reviews I wasn't sure about seeing this one but let me tell you my worries were put to rest very very soon this was one of the best times I have had at the movies this year the critics really missed the mark here I loved all the action and even the humor it was a good family movie as long as you have older kids due to the fact that the villans could be very frightening in spots and also this has a high level of action and it could overwhelm the youngest of kids but I still say get some snacks from the snack bar and be ready to have a super fun time at the movies with the entire family this thanksgiving weekend whether you go alone or take a group this is the movie to see,When it was first announced that 2016 would see _Batman V Superman_ and _Suicide Squad_ movies, I said to myself ""Okay, I didn't like _Man of Steel_, but there's two very different DC entries coming up, I'll watch both of them, and if I like even one of them I'm willing to give this franchise a go."" 

I didn't like either of them.

Marvel had never interested me growing up. I was a Batman-kid through and through, so as hard as a decision as it was to make, I decided I wouldn't be back to watch this run of DC movies, because for me, it was three swings, three misses.

Enter _Wonder Woman_ earlier this year. Though I had decided to not give this film series any more of money, I went back on my word and watched it opening weekend. Half ""one-last-hail-Mary"" and half ""I don't mind voting with my money to see more female-led superhero movies"". I loved it so much, that I was instantly back on the DC universe train.

Now we have _Justice League_.

I like to rank franchises according to my personal tastes. When it comes to what I refer to as the ""DCIThoughtSheWasWithU"" I dislike _Man of Steel_, _BVS_ & _Suicide Squad_ all roughly the same amount for different reasons, so it's tough to work out which comes in second place, which is third an which is fourth. But as surely as I know that _Wonder Woman_ comes first, _Justice League_ comes last.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._,**Our childhood superheroes all together !!**


Yet again a new DC installment from one of the most controversial directors of Hollywood Zack Snyder, who directed Man of Steel (2013) and Dawn of Justice (2016). The large of number of nerds around the globe are waiting for this from the childhood to see their favorite iconic heroes team up for the first time in Cinematic history. The basic plot of movie revolves around some deadly external threat wanting to conquer earth like every other CBM adaptations. The movie offers the same story as we see in most of the fandoms where a group of lonesome warriors come together to save earth.

“Men are still good”, deeply inspired by the Superman, Batman has again gained his faith in humanity and wants to start working for it and saving it. The Batman continuing its investigation on what Lex Luthor was planning to do in Dawn in Justice. Diana and him are uniting some new members like Victor Stone Aka Cyborg and Arthur Curry aka Aquaman and Barry Allen aka Flash in order to find their potential for good and unite against common threats when the world need it.The movie shows how people who lives alone finds it hard to adjust among new people. One of most important part of the movie is The Superman in his full character development, and showing to audience that sometimes Superhero needs other Superheroes to save them, because at the end of the day everybody loves a classic DC story where “Superman saving everyone and beating the crap out of bad guys”.

The performance of characters was good as the “material” was given to them. Batman which is played by Ben Affleck in JL was a bit out of character unlike the previous ones i.e. in Dawn Of Justice where he was The Freaking Bat ,The Worst Knightmare. He was purest personification of Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight, brutal, badass emotionless vigilante who everyone fears but in JL he was watered down too low and Yeah the guy smiles too. It may be horrifying to see Joker smiling but trust me its more horrifying to see Batman smiling . After her wonderful victory over RT Gal Gadot could do a lot better. Wonder Woman was kind of distracted and could not establish character as she did it in Dawn Of Justice and Wonder Woman,or may be we were expecting more. Cyborg who is a brilliant sportsman who lost his life after an accident. It was good to see Zack tried to show how life of normal human changes after horrifying accidents. The guy is in conflict with himself which is brilliantly played by Ray Fisher. Just like Ben Affleck Ezra miller too was first hated then became everyone’s favorite kid in JL. His conversations brings the tone of movie somewhat lighter. Now we have king of Atlantis, He looks like Khal Drogo had a kid with some most beautiful mermaid. Thanks to Jason Momoa ,Aquaman is total badass unlike its previous versions . I don’t want to spoil Superman but yeah Henry really nailed it.He finally became The Superman everybody wanted. His journey is complete. He knows why he is here, to save us all. We had another badass mortal on the team, He is Alfred portrayed Sir. Jeremy Irons. Actually we are not in a position to judge Sir Jeremy but yeah he was one of the best parts you will love in JL. We saw his sassy quick-witted talk with Bruce. You may find the movie is not catchy ,may be this was result of messed up situation where Zack Snyder left the movie due to his personal problems and put it in hands of other director Joss Whedon. Those two are totally different in their approaches so it resulted in such situation.

Although you may find a lot of negativity about this movie like previous DC films, because one of the things that audience forgets that DC characters are very dark unlike their contrary Marvel whose characters are cheesy and kind of funny, their stories and plots revolve around words like Hope , Justice and humanity not like Shawarma or Devil’s Anus jokes .This is a average movie not an Avengers movie. One thing I want to say that they kind of rushed to create a team up rather than Solo movies of Characters. This kinds of things  makes hard for audience to adjust as they don’t bond with DC characters as easily they do with Marvel one’s. The CGI was somewhat down as compared to other CBM’s and could have been a lot better. 


_Overall_, the movie will attract you if you see it as first team up not if you compare with other ones. This DC movie is worth watching.,The much-anticipated Justice League, the follow-up to 2016’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, was finally released on November 17, 2017. After Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were both negatively received, Warner Bros. saw a glimmer of hope with the highly-received Wonder Woman and hoped this would push the DCEU forward onto greatness. I saw Justice League on the 19th of November and my consensus: It’s Not Good. Opening to $94 million for its first weekend and with a 40% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Justice League underperformed both financially and critically. 10 years ago, I would have laughed at the idea of a Guardians of the Galaxy film beating Justice League at the box office and be much better received. Justice League’s performance puts the future of the DCEU in jeopardy.
Due to a personal tragedy in Zack Snyder’s life, he stepped down as director and Joss Whedon (director of The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron) took over post-production with reshoots and filming additional scenes. Most would have assumed that because of Joss Whedon’s reputation, he would be a great asset to the production of Justice League. However, that was strongly not the case. Zack Snyder intended to make this movie with a much lighter tone than Batman v Superman, but Zack Snyder’s style just does not blend well with Joss Whedon’s. What we’re left with is a DC film badly trying to be a Marvel film and the tone is an inconsistent mess throughout. The film loses its sense of identity and doesn’t know what tone (light or dark) it wants to incorporate. Thanks to Warner Bros. meddling with the production of the film and purposely sabotaging Zack Snyder’s vision (as much as I dislike his directing style), we’re left with a film full of sloppy editing and pacing, inconsistent tone, forgettable/unmemorable music, rushed “development” of characters, a terribly developed villain, thin plot and clunky CGI throughout. 

The movie directly follows the death of Superman in the previous film, triggering a sense of fear in people and allowing Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons to seek the 3 Mother Boxes on Earth to trigger a mass transformation of the planet. But instead of showcasing his initial invasion on Earth, the film starts off with disjointed scenes that don’t connect with one another. First with a video recording of Superman looking like he doesn’t want to even be recorded, then jumps to Batman using a criminal to capture a Parademon, then again to Wonder Woman thwarting a terrorist plot (which has nothing to do with the overall narrative), then jumps to a fully-bearded Bruce Wayne attempting to recruit Aquaman. There is no smooth transition between scenes and just results in a jumbled mess that really doesn’t show us a sense of urgency as to why Diana and Bruce want to recruit a team of meta-humans. 

The movie should really give us a reason as to why Steppenwolf should be feared, but instead, he is portrayed as a generic, badly rendered CGI figure that utters generic villain dialogue and just suddenly appears in Themiscyra through a Boom Tube. We are not given a scene showing who Steppenwolf is or why he’s returned to Earth before arriving to Themiscyra. While there is a scene showing Steppenwolf’s original invasion on Earth and his subsequent defeat by the combines forces of Humans, Atlanteans, Amazonians and Green Lanterns, it’s narrated by Wonder Woman and misplaced during a random moment when she’s explaining the Mother Boxes after he has invaded Themiscyra. The movie should have started off with developing a strong sense of interest for Steppenwolf and his reason for obtaining the Mother Boxes (is he doing this on his own accord or is a higher being – Darkseid – ordering him to do so?). Then show his original invasion on Earth without having Wonder Woman to tell us about Steppenwolf. Steppenwolf is basically Loki: They both wore a helmet with horns, they were both given orders by a higher being to retrieve a box (or boxes), they both commanded an army of disposable CGI monsters, they both arrived to Earth through a portal, and both attempted to conquer the world. But the big difference? Loki is actually likeable, while Steppenwolf is greatly forgettable. 

Superman, the “beacon of hope” as described by Bruce Wayne, is nothing of the sort. He was portrayed as a strongly brooding figure in both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, but we do not once see Superman acting as this beacon. Instead, he looked as if he hates saving people and always has a blank expression on his face. There is no sense of romance between him and Lois or him being a beacon of hope, we’re just told that and are expected to believe that. However, his character sees much improvement in Justice League. One of the aspects I enjoyed about the film was actually Superman. In the film’s climax, he actually felt and acted like the Superman we all knew and loved in the past (excluding his two previous films). His revival was quite satisfying, especially when Bruce knew he may not be the same person as before. Then we’re given a glimpse into an Evil Superman where he easily manages to take on all the Justice League members. What I especially liked was seeing The Flash attempt to run behind Superman and as he’s in the Speed Force, Superman moves his eyes and head to stare directly at Barry, catches him off-guard and he’s left with a “WTF” expression on his face. This was honestly one of the best moments of the entire film, but is very short-lived. Lois Lane comes to the rescue and seems to knock Superman out of his disoriented state and they fly back to Smallville. After some brief dialogue, Superman seems to be back to his old self. I just felt his state of mind reverting back to his original self was rushed and relied heavily on Lois Lane to do the job.

Batman is seen as the weakest member of the Justice League and is turned into a complete joke in this film. He even utters one-liners and is a much more light-hearted character in stark contrast to his debut in Batman v Superman. It’s very out of character for Bruce Wayne/Batman to be this way. It makes him seem like the DC equivalent of Tony Stark. It’s also apparent that Ben Affleck wants to no longer play Batman, I can totally tell that he just doesn’t seem to care anymore about the role. But he is given terrible material to work with, and I can understand why he would want to stop playing the role. I just hope Ben Affleck can see a glimmer of hope in the upcoming Batman solo reboot. 

Not much to say about Wonder Woman, since her solo film was spectacular and she continued to be damn amazing in this film, but I was utterly disgusted that DC felt it was necessary to overly-sexualize her by capturing close shots of her chest and ass. They even get up-skirt shots of her. It undermines her character established in her solo film and delegates her to being mere eye candy in the eyes of men. Plus the terrorist plot she thwarted, though it was an awesome moment, has no purpose and was a waste of screen time.

Cyborg is easily the least interesting character of the group. There’s brief development that I assume he holds resentment towards his father for bringing him back as “monster.” We’re not given an inner struggle with Cyborg struggling to deal with the fact of his condition, but the film has to quickly gloss over the Justice League members introduced in Batman v Superman via e-mail attachment in order to form the team. His only shining moment is in the final battle where he is the only one that can separate the Mother Boxes before Steppenwolf can enact his plan. But in Batman v Superman, from the video file, it seemed as if the Mother Box fused with Cyborg, so why is the box still a separate entity? It should have been fused with Cyborg and would raise the stakes a bit higher because Steppenwolf could use Cyborg to fuse with the other Mother Boxes and would force the Justice League to do everything in their power to save him. 

Ezra Miller’s The Flash seems to be DC’s response to Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. However, The Flash is a much worse version of Spider-Man with very cringe-worthy dialogue. He’s socially awkward and without hesitation, he immediately agrees to join Bruce Wayne for the reason of wanting friends. What the hell? We saw some development with Barry Allen striving to prove his father’s innocence, but why join the Justice League for the sole purpose of making friends? Plus he even explains to Batman that he has never been in a battle, yet he was shown to be the one that apprehended Captain Boomerang. He is never given a shining moment except for saving a family in Russia and challenging Superman to a race in the mid-credits scene. 

Jason Momoa as Aquaman was actually amazing, though he is bogged down by very limited screen time and little to no development. It honestly makes me quite excited for the upcoming Aquaman solo film slated for release late-2018. But a major annoyance I had with Aquaman was that he completely disappears from the movie after fighting off Steppenwolf, then suddenly reappears when the team is fighting Steppenwolf and Parademons in the sewers. There is no explanation as to how he arrived to the sewers, he just appears there. And that is the only time we truly see his powers is when he stops a column of water from flushing them out. In the final battle, they are nowhere near a water source, so what good is Aquaman if he cannot use his powers? However, it leaves me wanting to know more about Aquaman. Despite those annoyances, I thought the scene where Aquaman is unknowingly sitting on the Lasso of Truth and starts to speak the truth about their situation was fantastic and quite humorous, especially his reaction to when he realizes he was sitting on the lasso. 

The final battle between Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons against the Justice League has very low stakes and takes place in an obscure location in Russia. Unlike The Avengers, where the battle took place in New York and resulted in severe collateral damage, which raised the stakes a lot, Justice League’s climax doesn’t have a sense of world-ending urgency. It’s just a giant CGI battle with the only memorable moment being Aquaman riding a Parademon through a building. There’s no shining moments like Hulk slamming Loki or Hawkeye jumping off the building and shooting at the Chitauri as he’s falling. As Cyborg is struggling to separate the Mother Boxes, Superman appears when all hope seems to be lost and absolutely beats the shit out of Steppenwolf, breaking his weapon and his own Parademons attack him since they smell his fear of defeat. It made Steppenwolf seem like nothing but a giant push-over. But what especially irks me is that the original plan was to have Steppenwolf attempt to sway Superman to join him, Superman is given an apocalyptic vision( similar to the one Batman saw) and he actually sees Darkseid and this snaps Superman out of it and he delivers the final blow to defeat Steppenwolf. 

Though it’s a competent film and I really wanted to enjoy this film, Justice League is a complete let-down that should have been a huge movie event. Given its box office numbers and critical reception, this puts the future of the DCEU in a troubling position. They really should have given each of the heroes a solo film before releasing Justice League, but it’s apparent that Warner Bros. was way more concerned with catching up with Marvel than actually developing a shared universe with well-developed characters. Justice League just did not resonate with me and we can mainly thank Warner Bros. for rushing this film and delivering a disappointing product. 

Closing Comments 
- When Cyborg links up to the Nightcrawler, Alfred asks him if he knows him. Alfred and Diana were in the Batcave together when Cyborg reached out to them, Alfred should have recognized his voice completely.
- Steppenwolf should have been a much better-developed villain with a well-defined purpose.
- Mixing the styles of two directors in this film gave it a wildly inconsistent tone. 
- The humor, thought it did lighten up the mood, doesn’t work well with Zack Snyder’s style and feels out of place. 
- What was the deal with putting so much focus on that Russian family? It takes you out of the element of the final battle and is a cheap attempt at raising the stakes.
- When Steppenwolf was first defeated thousands of years ago, why did they all entrust the humans with a Mother Box? Shouldn’t the Green Lantern Corps be alerted that one of their own perished in the battle? They could have taken the Mother Box back with them, but they didn’t.
- Overall, the movie suffers from trying to do too much with too little time. DC really needs to reevaluate their future releases and as much as we all want another Justice League, they should put all their focus on standalone titles to fully flesh out their characters for now.
- That post-credits scene featuring Slade Wilson/Deathstroke visiting a recently escaped and bald Lex Luthor is a set-up for the Injustice League/Legion of Doom, which would make for an interesting idea for the Justice League sequel (if it does happen).

Rating: 4/10,This was my type of Super Hero movie. Simple, straightforward plot without much social nonsens and preaching. Little in terms of the all too common whining and sel pitying by the heroes. They are heroes all the way without any nonsensical vendettas or moral bullshit (mostly). There is an episode with a temporary memory lapse and some unnecessary slowdown but it is quickly dealt with.

On Wikipedia you can read that the movie was criticized for its “overuse of CGI”. Well, go watch another movie then for Christ sake! News Flash: It is a Super Hero movie! There are supposed to be a shitload of CGI in a super hero movie. Personally I enjoyed every second of the FX loaded scenes.

I am quite happy to finally see a real Super Hero movie and especially to see Batman and Superman again after that utterly abysmal train wreck Batman v. Superman.

I liked all the heros in this movie. The Flash was a bit silly at times but it was bearable. Gal Gadot is as hot (I had to say it) as ever as Wonder Woman. There are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone. Aquaman accidentally sitting on Wonder Woman’s “truth lasso” was quite hilarious actually.

The SF was generally great. I really liked the explosive action scenes. The colorful tendrils that invaded the land around Steppenwolf’s lair was a bit si-so though. They should have kept them just black and red at least.
Steppenwolf himself was okay. From a distance he was pretty great but up close (and there was really too many up close scenes of him) he looked…not so great, especially when talking.

There are a couple of stupid faults of course. Usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them. Leaving the, obviously, all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when Steppenwolf grabbed it was a real low.

Anyway, I really liked this movie. I do hope we get more like it.,The length is so fitting on the storytelling, what else does everyone need? I know that the trailer had so many scenes that we wanted to see, but for me, the movie and its duration are perfect!

The performances were amazing, especially Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman!

And the story was great, but not lie BvS, my favorite DCEU movie actually, but still, it has a great story though!

The CGI of Steppenwolf was great too, Steppenwolf as a character was threatening and violent, and that's a thing I wanted to see actually! The CGI in general was great and stunning!

A Justice League movie that every DC fan deserves in my opinion.

I'm gonna give it a 10/10, I think it's an amazing movie, with such great stuff in it.. and it's absolutely worth watching!,The Movie was highly paced. The movie was focusing on how the Justice league assembles. Stupidly shown the Mother Boxes and Stepenwolf. No future prospectus or hints unlike Dawn of Justice. Darkseid and Stepenwolf relation unknown. The movie falls apart as it was mainly focused on Resurrection of Superman and Assemble of other members.,Never lived up to its hype. The story was a bit rushed, the humor was forced, and it was a bit messy. All were happening at once that you couldn’t understand what was going on.,I have to say, I find it lighthearted and entertaining at least, though sometimes, you will find the plot to be rather confusing.,I think hardcore DC comic fans will appreciate the movie more than the general audience will. Being a DC fan, I enjoyed it a bit more because of the references from the comic books that it made.,A good movie with all your favorite characters. Pretty entertaining, but it won't match up to the meticulous world-building of the MCU. Still, a pretty decent movie.,The biggest flaw of the film was that it didn’t fully utilized its characters. They just jumbled up some of the members of the Justice League from the comics, gave it a substandard representation of a villain, and called it a day.,Great potential, poor execution. I was disappointed, to be honest. We were expecting a lot for this movie, but I guess DCEU was a tad bit too late in the film game. Their TV series was much more promising than their movies.,It was a pretty decent movie. Better than what I expected, but it was deeply flawed.,The Flash was definitely the comic relief for this one! I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I would have liked it, even more, if it is not kind of being rushed.,If I can point it all out, there is so much wrong with this movie, especially the villain. I will choose Batman v Superman, which had really awesome action scenes, than this Justice League.,DCEU is making a comeback with this one! Finally, after many years of slumber, it is catching up with MCU at least. Although I can say it is not the best of the best, at least, they are finally learning.,DCEU is making a comeback with this one! Finally, after many years of slumber, it is catching up with MCU at least.

We started rocking the shatter bong hardcore, just pump it, pump it, till you can actually feel your brain melting, then hit that nail and do it again and again. At some point somebody asked the question ""where are we?"" and while I was reflecting philosophically on the matter, somebody else pointed out that we were parked in a lot by the cineplex and we slowly realized that we were here to see 'The Last Jedi'! I could barely function at all, so I went to my old go-to routine of donning dark glasses and a white cane to help disguise my complete stonification by pretending I was just some poor blind guy stumbling around and knocking things over. I usually do this to get past security at rock concerts and it never crossed my mind that a blind guy wouldn't be able to see a movie in the first place, but it worked anyway and soon enough we were in our seats. There were these fucking kids sitting right behind us and they kept kicking my seat like little retards, kicking, kicking, kicking.... so I took the lid off my extra-large Coke and just tossed it over my shoulder. Bingo! Direct hit! The little creeps shuffled off all pissed and whining, covered in sticky cola, us laughing at them, calling them losers, it was great! 

Then the movie started. The sound was awesome and everything but the screen was pretty freakin' dark I thought, could hardly make out anything. I started chanting ""Turn up the brightness! Turn up the brightness!"", expecting the rest of the audience to join in to my righteous chant of outrage, but then I realized I still had my Blind Guy Glasses on. Took 'em off and yup, cleared right up. There was some kind of big space battle going on so we took out our vape pens and started hoofing back lungfuls of sweet sweet shatter vapor. My girlfriend started texting me, bitching at me to pick her up some vag pads on the way home. WTF?? Get up off your fat ass and get 'em yourself I texted back. A barrage of bitchtexts followed, I was a jerk, I was an asshole and bla bla bla... I took a picture of my bare ass and sent it to her as a reply, fuckin bitch, anyway, apparently, this was considered 'indecent exposure' according to the usher-dork who wouldn't shut up about it so we had to leave the movie. We saw those stupid kids in the lobby as we were being escorted out, laughing at US, calling US 'losers'... I wanted to get back at them when they came out, even formed this elaborate plan where we would swoop down on them and soak them with freezing water this time, but we ended up just getting high again then went to Burger King.,My oldest son, as well as myself of course, wanted to watch this movie already before Christmas when it went up Geneva but it was pretty much sold out (unless you wanted to sit at the very edge of the theatre). I manage to book tickets for yesterday though so…here’s my ramblings about the movie.

As usual with these kind of movies, where there is a large following of fans, there is also many dissenting voices. Some people apparently are going as far as to want this movie to be undone. Well, my take on that is that these people need to grow up or let go or both. Luke is no longer a young farm boy running around saving the universe. The Star Wars universe and its characters are evolving and that is the way it should be and the way it is. Time for the next generation to pick up the torch.
Both me and my son really liked this movie. After the abysmal episodes I to III (Jar Jar Binks still haunts me in my dreams) I have really enjoyed the Star Wars movies.

I quite liked The Force Awakens but it is true that it felt a bit like a rehash of A New Hope. Not only does this one not feel like it is reusing old material (too much) but it also feels like it is opening a new chapter in the Star Wars universe.
The FX is as good as you have the right to expect from a Star Wars movie. The story is fresh and well developed. It will not win any Oscars of course but I liked it. It makes things evolve while at the same time giving enough room for action and a wee bit of humor.

The characters are almost all good and well played. I am looking forward to seeing more of most of them, especially, Rey and Poe. I’m not 100% convinced about Finn and Rose but I can live with them.  Kylo Ren do not yet fill up the shoes of Darth Vader but he is showing promise. Contrary to Snoke I do feel he should put on a mask though.

The two characters I did not really like was General Hux and DJ. The first one was just incompetent. I’m not sure if he was supposed to be a bit of comical relief or not but, as far as I am concerned, we can do without him. DJ, well I guess he was supposed to not be liked so he did a good job of that but these kinds of assholes just frustrate me to no end. We never saw him actually meet his demise in this movie so if he is brought back I hope it will be for the sole purpose of rectifying that oversight…as violently and painfully as possible.

Of course, we saw a few new ships as well and as usual with the Empire bigger is better…or maybe not. Not sure what to say about these new designs. At least they did not look like a enlarged (except for the bridge) Star Destroyer like Darth Vader’s Super Star Destroyer.

One thing that really bugged me in the first battle though was the rebels’ so called “bombers”. What kind of bloody moron designed those? They were just so wrong in so many ways. The design itself was just silly looking. They were slower than a flee on a patch of tar. Seriously, a space bomber that crawls along? Actually, why make a “bomber” in space at all? That brings us to the biggest gripe of them all with this ludicrous design…dropping bombs vertically? In space? How the fuck do they fall?

Sure they looked somewhat cool when they dropped their bombs…if your knowledge of physics is on the level of your average politician (and obviously a few Hollywood employees as well).

Anyway, on the whole me and my son had two and a half hours of great fun watching The Last Jedi. I hope the next movie expands on the threads this one started. I have to say that I was a bit sorry about the feeble state of the resistance at the end, so I do hope the next writer will not let this drag on. One way to ruin Star Wars for me would be to turn Star Wars into some Battlestar Galactica variant with resistance survivors on constant run from the empire. Now it is time for the resistance to strike back, and for Rey to evolve her Jedi powers.,There is so much to love about _The Last Jedi_. I was very entertained watching this 8th _Star Wars_ saga film, I'll see it again, there's some truly beautiful scenes, all that jazz. But I am not fully on board with _The Last Jedi_. The film is a fun watch, and if you were to take it as a whole, then place it in a bubble, it's a pretty good movie too, but a lot about it is... Pointless. I'm not saying the movie was pointless, it has a lot to offer, and deserves its place as Episode VIII, but there are moments started within _The Last Jedi_ that end up being pointless by the time the credits roll, and more than that, it goes back to ideas from the _Star Wars_ saga as a whole, and makes them pointless too.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._,Really disappointing. Our heroes of Star Wars have essentially wasted their lives and achieved nothing. 

We were promised sequels and got a retread. I for one would have loved to see the building of the Galactic Republic against terrorists of the Imperial Remnant. Instead, we got Failure Luke, Failure Leah, gone nowhere Chewie and a rebel alliance that appeared to entirely fail to do anything meaningful after episode 6. 

I actually have less difficulty accepting 1,2 and 3 into canon then I do this pap. My headcanon has already decided, these movies do not count.,The Last Jedi started with a very tense emotion, capturing all viewers' attention tightly including mine (I've seen all movie episodes of Star Wars series so this type of scenario should look familiar to me).

This tense and epic feeling filled the entire film, so even it is a bit lengthy, people won't sleep over :) however, the scenes involving Rey and Luke on the isolated island planet look super quiet and mindful. It was similar to the scene in previous episode when Luke was seeking help from the Yoda Master. However, it felt more complex, because never had Yoda been described being evil, not a bit.

One tiny detail that I felt redundant and unconvincing was the reincarnation of Leia Princess. How did she fly back to the ship? As far as I can tell, no reason is given in the film. This lets you suspect whether she was going to be who can command the Force like a Jedi, but well all you can do is just suspecting.

Another critical option that I had to express was about the role of Kylo Ren. He is a complex character, and I am not sure that he believed in until the very end of the story. The climax of this complexity arrived at the scene when he killed Snoke and fought along with Rey, trying to persuading her to come for *a new world*. But this complexity simply came and disappeared. The story continued in the old way and our powerless always furious Ben Solo kept playing a simpleton role of any typical bad guy. The role is depicted as, adequately complex, but not consistent and lively enough (compared to the former Lord Darth Vader).,Star Wars: The Last Jedi – This Is Not The Film You’re Looking For

Star Wars: The Force Awakens kicked off the Sequel Trilogy and many proclaimed the movie has returned Star Wars back to form. Though the plot of the movie is literally the same as A New Hope, The Force Awakens invoked mysticism of the characters and plot elements and raised numerous unanswered questions that would hopefully be answered in the next installment. Star Wars: The Last Jedi follows directly after the events of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and though the film attempts to hurl the Star Wars franchise into newer territory, the Last Jedi is a visually stunning spectacle that managed to undermine everything established in The Force Awakens and does great deal of disservice to our legacy characters. 

Rey – Overpowered?

One of the biggest gripes I had with The Force Awakens was that Rey was insanely good at just about everything. She beat Kylo Ren, an experienced Force user, with no Force/lightsaber training, performed a Jedi mind trick with ease, flew the Millennium Falcon with little trouble, and managed to stop Kylo Ren from probing her mind. We were introduced to the mystery of Rey’s parents and her strength with the Force, neither of which are addressed in The Last Jedi. A relatively short passage of time occurs between films and Rey is even more overpowered than ever, receiving absolutely no training from Luke and she bests him (a Jedi Master!) in combat with no explanation as to how she is so strong with the Force. Luke in the Original Trilogy started off as a farm boy who has no knowledge of the Force until Obi-Wan teaches him about it. He received training by Yoda and failed miserably at combating Darth Vader, losing a hand and his lightsaber in the process. By the time of Return of the Jedi, Luke is established as being an experienced Force user who constructed a new lightsaber and is able to perform Jedi mind tricks. Rey, on the other hand, shows no signs of struggle and easily manages to lift boulders by the end of the film (Luke struggled to even concentrate and lift a small amount of rocks when training with Yoda). The film offers no attempt to address Rey’s Force strength and we’re left with having to accept she’s strong for no reason. Had there been a much longer passage of time between films, then it would be a bit more acceptable. However, her unanswered strength in the Force further solidifies the fact that she is overpowered. Rian Johnson has set her overpowered nature in stone and doesn’t leave much room for her character to grow and develop in Episode IX. All that we can expect for Episode IX is another showdown between Kylo Ren and Rey and it’s obvious that Rey will win.

Finn & Rose – The Canto Bight Tales

Finn was established in The Force Awakens as a former First Order Stormtrooper that became disillusioned with the First Order and decides to flee, getting as far away from the First Order as possible. Finn decides to stop running away when Rey gets captured by Kylo Ren, overcoming his fears and decides to take charge in rescuing her. He even directly battles Kylo Ren at the end, though he is easily defeated and severely injured. His character (and his arc) is tossed aside in The Last Jedi, delegated to being just a side character of no importance to the film’s plot. Finn is paired up with Rose (who’s just as bad as Jar Jar Binks) and go on a mission to Canto Bight to look for a master codebreaker to disable the First Order’s hyperspace tracker. The Canto Bight segment is easily the worst portion of the film that drives the pacing to a screeching halt, offers nothing of importance to the overall plot and results in no actual payoff. Finn and Rose conveniently find a hacker (DJ) when jailed for a parking ticket and manage to escape, freeing numerous abused horse-like animals in the process but leaving the slave children behind. When on board Snoke’s flagship, they are caught by the First Order and DJ reveals he tipped the First Order to save his own skin and for a monetary reward (So unexpected!). Finn battles with Captain Phasma, who is quickly discarded and they steal a transport to Crait. During the Battle of Crait, Finn is given a tremendous moment to shine as a hero when he decides to sacrifice himself by flying the vessel directly into the Death Star-like battering ram, but is pushed out of the way by Rose who delivers a cringe-worthy line of “saving what we love.” This moment will forever solidify Rose as the worst Star Wars character and steals Finn’s moment of glory. His sacrifice would have given Finn a solid character arc from a cowardly First Order deserter to being a heroic figure who gave his life to save others. Rose’s idiotic choice could have resulted in the First Order wiping out the Resistance and she will always be remembered as the character that managed to be worse than Jar Jar Binks.

Poe v Holdo – Dawn of the SJW

Poe Dameron is an exceptionally skilled pilot that planned a calculated attack on the First Order Dreadnought and though his plan to destroy the Dreadnought resulted in numerous Resistance casualties, Poe is successful at destroying the Dreadnought, but is immediately demoted by General Organa (Leia) and command is given to Vice Admiral Holdo (Purple Haired SJW). Poe knew the risks of war and deemed it necessary at the moment to destroy the Dreadnought and had he not acted on his gut instinct, the Resistance would have been completely obliterated. Instead, he is treated like he’s a bumbling idiot and Holdo refused to even notify Poe of the plan with the escape pods. It honestly feels as if this film has an SJW/Feminist agenda that strongly attempts to make the male characters (Poe, Hux, Kylo Ren, etc.) as nothing but idiots and elevates the women to a level of superiority. Politics will always have a place in the Star Wars franchise (the Prequels were built upon a politically driven foundation), but not in this shape or form. Even though Poe’s plan of destroying the Dreadnought was successful and allowed for the Resistance to escape, he is seen as unhinged and acting out of line by Holdo, never once acknowledging Poe for his heroic action of practically saving the Resistance. Poe is denied the opportunity of being the heroic figure, but it was perfectly acceptable for Holdo to sacrifice herself by flying the Resistance cruiser through Snoke’s ship. Holdo did nothing memorable to deserve a heroic sacrifice and it’s absolutely disgraceful that Poe’s character is painted as this unhinged, reckless pilot who is made out to be an idiot for his actions. Poe deserved a much better character progression in this film. As for Holdo, she was placed in this film for the sake of having a woman be in charge for no apparent reason other than to drive the fact that the man (Poe) is an “idiot” and the woman (Holdo) is the “superior, intelligent figure.”

Snoke – In The End, It Doesn’t Matter

Supreme Leader Snoke was set up to be the mastermind pulling the strings of the First Order and the next main villain after Palpatine. He is portrayed as a mysterious, disfigured individual who’s strong with the Force and swayed Ben Solo to the Dark Side. In The Last Jedi, he is seen dressed in golden robes in a red throne room and his royal Praetorian Guards protecting him. He displays a tremendous amount of strength in the Force by conjuring Force lighting directly into the ground and sending Kylo Ren flying back and suspending Rey in the air in an intensely painful Force grip. He even was able to merge the minds of Kylo Ren and Rey together across the galaxy using the Force. He was set up to be this figure who’s just as powerful and intimidating as Palpatine. But alas, Snoke is immediately discarded in the film and dies in a very unsatisfying manner. Who he is, where he came from and how he rose to power no longer matter: He’s just an extremely powerful and disfigured individual with no provided background information. Snoke decides it’s smart to place Luke’s lightsaber on the throne’s arm rest and continues to taunt and insult Kylo Ren with Rey on the floor. He orders Kylo Ren to kill Rey and gloats that he knows what Kylo Ren is thinking. However, Kylo Ren slowly moves Luke’s lightsaber towards Snoke with the Force (How Snoke or none of the Praetorian Guards notice is beyond comprehension). He then ignites the lightsaber, which impales Snoke and is then cut in half, the top half of his body tumbling to the floor. His death also puts the numerous fan theories to death. Snoke no longer matters. 

Kylo Ren – Still Throwing Tantrums

One of the best aspects of the film is not Luke Skywalker: it’s Kylo Ren. Right off from the start, Kylo Ren is insulted and scolded by Snoke, which causes Kylo Ren to leave the throne room and smash his mask into pieces. Kylo Ren is still shown to struggle with the Dark Side and when the opportunity comes to blow up the command bridge Leia is on, he hesitates and decides against killing his own mother. Kylo Ren seemed to solidify his status as a villain in The Force Awakens when he killed Han Solo and in this film, he questions his own intentions and through his Force communication with Rey, the idea that Kylo Ren could be redeemed is brought into question. It’s a very interesting idea seeing Kylo Ren possibly turning back to the Light Side. The team-up between Rey and Kylo Ren was also another well-done idea that showed Rey realizing that she could possibly bring Kylo Ren back to the Light. Rey decides to see Kylo Ren in an attempt to turn him away from the Dark Side, then it’s revealed that Snoke manipulated the Force between them to lure Rey to him. After Kylo Ren kills Snoke with Luke’s lightsaber, Rey and Kylo Ren team up with each other and take on the Praetorian Guards in one of the greatest combat sequences in all of Star Wars. Kylo Ren is able to easily defeat many of the Praetorian Guards and when it seems that Kylo Ren will turn away from the Dark Side, he asks Rey to join him by his side. Disillusioned by the fact that Kylo Ren just wanted to overthrow Snoke and assume leadership of the First Order, Rey and Kylo Ren engage in battle and destroy Luke’s lightsaber in the process. The idea of establishing Kylo Ren as the main villain of the Sequel Trilogy is quite intriguing and allows for more room to develop Kylo Ren into the ultimate villain, though it came at the cost of killing off Snoke. Overall, Kylo Ren is a very solid character with a more defined vision of being the leader of the First Order.

Leia Organa-Skywalker – I’m Mary Poppins, Y’all!

Sadly, this film marks Carrie Fisher’s final film appearance due to her death in late 2016. It was great to see more Leia in this film, though her role is largely downplayed and does not get a moment to shine like Luke and Han. Leia has been shown in past films to be Force-sensitive, but the way this film portrays her Force abilities is beyond terrible. After the command ship’s bridge is blown up, Leia gets sucked out into the vacuum of space and is assumed to be dead. However, she opens her eyes and is shown to have actually survived. She reaches out her hand and proceeds to literally fly towards the main Resistance cruiser that makes her Mary Poppins in space. We all knew Leia was Force-sensitive, but the way her Force abilities were portrayed was executed horribly. No one talks about or brings up Leia surviving while in space and Leia herself doesn’t even speak about it at all for the remainder of the film. She is hospitalized on the ship and command is then given not to Poe, but to Vice Admiral Purple Hair. Prior to her Mary Poppins moment, Leia berates Poe for his successful plan in destroying the Dreadnought and demotes him on the spot. Why is Leia so upset over Poe’s plan? Poe knew the risks in launching the attack and his plan resulted in the destruction of the Dreadnought and possibly killed thousands of First Order members. Leia and Holdo seemed to just team up on Poe, labeling him an idiot for launching a successful attack. Despite these issues, Leia should have been the one to fly the cruiser directly through Snoke’s flagship, it would have been the honorable way to send off Leia, allowing her to have a truly shining moment. Her Mary Poppins Force moment absolutely defies how the Force works. With the death of Carrie Fisher, her final performance as Leia ends on a quite dim note and she deserved a much better send-off.

Luke Skywalker – This Isn’t The Jedi You’re Looking For

After the cliffhanger of Rey handing Luke his blue lightsaber on Ahch-To, the fan base was eager with joy on what direction the story will go with the reveal of Luke Skywalker. Luke holds his original lightsaber and has a look of mixed emotions, then the unexpected happens: Luke throws the lightsaber over his shoulder and storms off. What should have been an epic moment in Star Wars history was turned into a moment for a cheap laugh. I take this scene as a metaphor for The Last Jedi: J.J. Abrams handing over The Force Awakens to Rian Johnson, who proceeds to throw out just about everything established in The Force Awakens for the sake of being “different” just because. Though I praise Mark Hamill’s epic performance as Luke Skywalker and honestly love Luke’s portrayal, the direction they placed for Luke was severely underwhelming. Luke reveals he traveled to Ahch-To for the sole purpose of wanting to die, which goes against what Han said about him seeking out the first Jedi Temple. So what was the point of the map in the previous film if he didn’t want to be found? Then in a flashback, he actually considered killing his own nephew at night by creepily sneaking into his hut and probing his mind, then discovers a lot of darkness and corruption by Snoke. So instead of confronting his nephew during the day, he considers killing him in his sleep? This is the same Luke that sensed the good in his father Darth Vader and personally went on a mission to bring his father back to the Light, of which he ultimately succeeds. Yet, because he probed Ben Solo’s mind and saw darkness, Luke deemed it necessary to just flat-out murder his nephew? This felt extremely out of character for Luke to even consider doing such a thing. This is also the same Luke that went out of his way to save the Rebellion, fought alongside the Rebellion, and played a major role in the Empire’s defeat. Then in this Sequel Trilogy, he gives up and lives in isolation after the massacre of his Jedi Academy, doesn’t seem to care at all about the rising threat of the First Order, and shuts himself off from the Force. Later in the movie, he has a change of heart and appears on Crait, walking directly towards the army of AT-M6s, AT-ATs, and AT-STs. He and Kylo Ren duel, though Luke doesn’t swing his lightsaber once and simply dodges all of Kylo Ren’s hits. Kylo Ren impales and slices Luke, but nothing happens and in a “twist”, Luke is revealed to be Force projecting himself and did not leave Ahch-To at all. He fades away from the battle, leaving behind a furious Kylo Ren. At the end of the film, Luke stumbles over on the rocks he was sitting on and looks out into the horizon, sees two suns (reminiscent of A New Hope) and dies, becoming one with the Force. Though I praise the idea of using a Force projection, it does a great disservice to Luke Skywalker’s character and undermines his character’s growth from the Original Trilogy. Luke should have physically appeared on Crait and demonstrated his vast strength in the Force by easily destroying the artillery and engaging in a fierce duel with Kylo Ren, but ultimately loses and is struck down by his nephew. That would have given tremendous emotional depth to Luke and be a showcase on how far along Luke has grown with the Force. 

Other Bad Moments In The Last Jedi

Like all Star Wars films, The Last Jedi features a lot of flaws and some very questionable moments that don’t do this movie any justice:
- Humor has a place in Star Wars, but not to the point of distorting the tone of the film, making it seem like a Marvel film (ex. Poe trolling Hux at the beginning of the film was cringe-worthy and feels out-of-place).
- General Hux was honestly a sinister figure in The Force Awakens. He is turned into a complete incompetent fool in this film and is oblivious to the fact he’s being prank called by Poe. 
- Captain Phasma was again underutilized and despite putting up a strong fight against Finn, she is quickly killed off. What was the point of bringing back Phasma?
- Canto Bight killed the pacing of the film and resulted in no beneficial pay-off to the movie’s overall plot. 
- Rose preaches about the rich being bad people for selling weapons to the First Order and feels the need to preach about the abuse the race animals face, yet offers no sympathy at all to the slave children.
- The final scene featuring the young slave child using the Force to pull the broom gives the idea that anyone can use the Force with no training whatsoever. 
- Luke doesn’t seem to react at all when he learns of Han Solo’s death.
- No Knights of Ren in this film, not even a mention or any clue as to their whereabouts.

Other Great Moments In The Last Jedi

Despite the numerous issues that plague this film, The Last Jedi features a lot of great moments that truly shine:
- The opening scene and subsequent assault on the Dreadnought was very action-packed and felt like a true Star Wars film
- The final battle on Crait, though highly reminiscent of the Battle of Hoth, was phenomenal and the idea of using a Death Star-like battering ram was well-executed. 
- Snoke’s throne room battle between the Praetorian Guards against Rey and Kylo Ren is honestly one of the greatest battles in all of Star Wars. It was well-choreographed, tense, and demonstrated how powerful a team Rey and Kylo Ren make.
- Finn and Captain Phasma’s battle was spectacular and seeing Phasma deflect a blaster shot with her armor was amazing.
- Rey and Kylo Ren’s Force communication added much needed development to both characters and added a layer of depth to their own motivations.
- Luke’s interactions with Rey were well-done, especially when Rey literally reaches her hand out to the Force, Luke plays along and brushes a leaf against her hand.
- Chewbacca feasting on a Porg and a group of Porgs look at him with fear in their eyes.
- Luke seeing R2-D2 on board the Millennium Falcon and R2-D2 plays the original message by Leia.
- Yoda’s appearance as a Force ghost and knocking some sense into Luke.
- Holdo flying the Resistance cruiser through hyperspace at Snoke’s flagship, resulting in the destruction of numerous First Order ships.
- Luke confronting the First Order on Crait, of which Kylo Ren orders them to fire at Luke with all their artillery. Luke walks out of the smoke undamaged and dusts his shoulder off.

Closing Comments 

Despite the film having moments of greatness scattered throughout its runtime, The Last Jedi is heavy on flaws that are magnified as the film progresses. The film seems to take the quote “Let the past die, kill it if you have to” to heart and literally kills the history of what’s came before, especially The Force Awakens. Just about everything established in The Force Awakens is simply swept under the rug. The end of the film places the Resistance back to the same state the Rebellion was at in A New Hope. Why is this new trilogy just simply repeating the past? Though Rian Johnson is a fantastic director, he simply does not work for Star Wars and proves with The Last Jedi he has no understanding of how Star Wars works, especially with regards to the Force. The Force is treated more like a superpower that anyone can attain with no training required. The Last Jedi is far from being the worst Star Wars film, but is still far from being the best. J.J. Abrams is slated to return to the franchise to direct Episode IX and will attempt to fix the mess that Rian Johnson left behind with this new trilogy. Help us, J.J. Abrams. You’re our only hope.

Rating: 6/10,Completely obliterates established Star Wars lore. 

The writers of this film have no respect for Star Wars nor do they have an imaginative bone in their body. I felt like I was watching a shonen jump anime with the overuse of comic relief and usually placed in the most awkward moments. It was a desperate attempt to copy Marvel movie writers and failing miserably. The way they presented Luke Skywalker was an abomination and the story of the film was just plain boring and didn't make sense in so many places that listing it here would be so long that it would put you to sleep. I had to watch the film in 3 sittings it was so bad. Disney has now properly fucked Star Wars.,The last jedi is clearly the last SW movie I`ll ever see. Everything was bad. Story, casting, acting, CGI, everything..  I just want my 2 hours back.. please..,""Not the best but certainly the most overhyped""

As the Rebellion tries to evade The First Order, Rey asks Luke Skywalker to teach her the ways of the Force. Meanwhile Kylo Ren is still a whiny POS.

Director/writer Rian Johnson faced a gargantuan task. Two years ago J.J. Abrams did the impossible by making a successful sequel to ‘Star Wars’. Johnson had to follow that up with something more creative because let’s be honest, ‘The Force Awakens’ (TFA) was a copy. He succeeds partially.

When the movie started there were cheers. It doesn’t get any better than the iconic opening crawl with John Williams’ score. Although there’s a certain resemblance to ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ (opening scene, Luke on the remote planet) ‘The last Jedi’ isn’t a copy. Johnson has came up with a more or less original story with new characters and some twists.
However, the problem with some of the new characters is that they get too much screen time while contributing nothing to the story. In some cases up to the point where they’re just plain annoying. Benicio Del Toro anyone? Meanwhile we find out nothing new about the characters we got to know in ‘TFA’. Rey, Finn & Dameron still feel new.

The villains are another problem. The most iconic part about ‘Star Wars’ has always been the villains. Darth Vader is an icon. Emperor Palpatine and Darth Maul were also quite impressive. Without spoiling anything I think it’s safe to say Kylo Ren (who’s still suffering from huge mommy and daddy issues), Supreme Leader Snoke & General Hux are terribly underwhelming.

That of course doesn’t mean it’s a bad movie. Although it runs too long it entertains. The effects and choreography are top notch and the overall look of the film is stunning. DOP Steve Yedlin does a fine job. The final battle looks amazing ( the red stripes on the salt plains). Although there’s a bit too much humor for our liking, there’s some genuine funny moments. The Porgs have a bright future ahead of them marketingwise.
Of course there’s the nostalgia factor. It’s great to see those familiar faces again and the sound of lightsabres and TIE fighters are music to our ears.

On the other hand it’s obvious Johnson and Disney want to go down a new path. Whether that path is the right one remains to be seen. With the announcement of a new trilogy coming up it feels like they’re milking it. And you can take that literally. What’s up with that milk scene? Cringeworthy.

The biggest problem is that ‘The Last Jedi’ is incredibly hyped. There are reviews that say the movie is dark and that it’s the best since ‘The Empire Strikes Back’. I know opinions can differ but it doesn’t come close to any of the original trilogy.,This one killed the franchise!  I have been watching Star Wars movies since they started literally, going to the theater and enjoying the fun.  Love the original three.  Liked the prequels well enough.  I even enjoyed the cute little Ewok movies, with the kids.  

These later films have been a mixed bag.  Most were watchable enough, though not really the caliber of the old films  Sure, the effects are great, but a good movie needs more than special effects and cool alien makeup and some fun droids.

This movie was seriously disappointing.  Everything about familiar characters was changed, and the plot was so busy with pushing some weird agenda that it failed to deliver any of what we go to a Star Wars movie to see.  At this stage, I couldn't care less about the newer characters, and the whole ""Mary Sue"" aspect to the one main girl (see, I can't even recall her name!) is just annoying.  This film w bad enough that the dedicated SW fanboy in my household just quit watching, and actualy, for the first time ever, skipped the following movie entirely.  

So, congrats, Disney; you killed one of the most successful franchises ever.,If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @

Finally, I managed to watch one of my most anticipated movies of 2017! I am an authentic fanboy of the Star Wars saga and I loved its return two years ago when The Force Awakens was released. Everything looked better, sounded better and the story certainly didn't disappoint me. So, obviously, I was extremely looking forward to The Last Jedi.

Apparently, critics love Episode VIII but fans not so much. Me, well ... I don't LOVE it, but I do enjoy it very much. I do think it is a bit below the previous film's overall quality since it definitely has some issues the first one did not. I am also confident that I know why the fans are not loving this movie and I will explain that after a few paragraphs.

This time, I am going to start at the other side of the spectrum. I will begin my review with the film's problems because I do need to get them out of my mind, especially this one ... The subplot involving Finn (John Boyega), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and DJ (Benicio Del Toro), some of the few new characters added to the franchise, completely ruins the movie's pacing and its narrative is such a tremendous deviation from the main story. It is, by far, the worst issue I have with the screenplay because it does not work as one single problem ... It creates a whole other set of them.

The first act's pacing is really fast since it starts with tons of action sequences. However, the second act decreases the rhythm and it is more story-driven, full of mystery-unlocking and character-development scenes. Finn and Rose's nonsense adventure just turns everything slower and even strange. It ends up needlessly extending the runtime (the film could have easily been 15min shorter) and worse ... Possibly creating a love triangle with Rey (I am not even going to discuss this).

Apart from this major issue(s), I have some minor problems. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) is a strong candidate to become the most annoying character in this new-generation trilogy. Gleeson is fine, he actually achieves a good over-the-top performance, but his character is just tumbling off the rails. Also, on a more technical aspect, the writing does not flow as well as it did on J.J. Abrams' screenplay. There are a lot more exposition scenes which also does not help the pacing at all.

I wrote earlier about the fans' reasons for them to be disappointed and well, the marketing for the movie did not lie: they do take a lot of chances with this one. Rian Johnson delivers a lot of twists and shocks throughout the whole runtime and it is impossible to assume that every single one of them is going to be mind-blowing and unanimously accepted. I do not want to give anything away from the plot, so I am just going to write that most of the choices and paths they choose for each character, I either simply accept them or I truly love them. As for the rest, I am, at most, underwhelmed (yet, I trust and understand the decisions they went with).

People need to learn how to deal with their own expectations. If you expect something utterly absurd and nonsensical to occur and then it does not, you can't blame the film for not following your crazy idea. So, please, don't start blabbing any movie is bad or disappointing because it didn't fulfill your ridiculously high expectations. Even if they are grounded and thoughtful, you have to embrace the production's approach to the character/story. If it makes sense, then it is as valid as any other theory. It might be underwhelming if you have high expectations, but it is still a serious take on whatever you are thinking.

This is why I think fans are not loving The Last Jedi. The production takes a lot of risks and some of them don't work with everyone, mostly due to fans' radical theories that don't have a place in the film. I think most people might change their initial opinion after a second viewing, myself included. Some things just need more time to process or even a whole rewatch. Since I do not have time to do it before the year's end, I am going with what I have.

Switching to the light side (hehe), I do enjoy this movie a lot. Every cast member that was great in Episode VII, transcends themselves in this one. Daisy Ridley is superb as Rey. She has such a massive range of expressions and I am sure her successful future as an actress is surely guaranteed. From the most emotional and somber moments to the most epic action scenes, she is awesome. Her character's mysterious backstory reaches a whole new extent and her interactions with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Luke Skywalker inflict chills all over my body.

Mark Hamill's comeback can't be any more amazing than it is. He delivers a fantastic, emotion-full and very compelling performance. It is even more unbelievable knowing that Hamill had strong personal arguments against the director's interpretation of what was better for Luke. If he is this astounding working against his own idea of who his character really is, then I must praise his exemplary working principles.

Luke and Rey spend a big chunk of the runtime training on an unknown island and I love every single second filmed on that piece of land. I have to admit that I am a bit frustrated because I think the film should have more time with these two, but due to the issues mentioned in the beginning of my review, the runtime can't be much more stretched. I love what they did with Luke, even if some fans are going to go insane with his journey.

Adam Driver as Kylo Ren ... The undoubtful star of the whole show. Driver is becoming a menace to every actor working today because he is flawless. He has a powerful, dark, mysterious, compelling and commanding display as one of the most complex and multi-layered characters of the Star Wars saga. Ren's conflict inside his mind and heart is the most captivating feature of his story and his interactions with Rey are so jaw-dropping spectacular that I can't even describe them properly.

John Boyega is once again great as Finn, even though he is part of that horrible subplot. Boyega delivers a convincing performance and Finn shines through some awesome action set pieces. Kelly Marie Tran is actually good as Rose, it is just a pity that her character suffers from the narrative, even though her backstory is pretty touching. Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the Porgs, the new cute animals implemented in the Star Wars universe, have all the funny scenes plus some action here and there.

Oscar Isaac is quite lucky because Poe Dameron unquestionably has the best subplot of the movie. Isaac offers a very passionate display as Poe goes through some significant character development. His impulsive instincts to attack the bad guys always have consequences and he is put in check by Leia (Carrie Fisher) during the whole time. It is a very interesting and twistful story that elevates the film's main plot.

Carrie Fisher is elegant and beautiful as Leia, a character that has a lot more screentime than what I expected. I always love seeing Fisher on the screen and she makes everything a bit more realistic to me. Andy Serkis is remarkable as Supreme Leader Snoke, but his character is yet another plot's detail that fans are not going to appreciate so much. I still feel underwhelmed by Snoke in this movie for several reasons, but after some thinking, I do understand his role in the film and his moments are indeed intimidating and dominant.

Rian Johnson work as the director is better than him as the writer. The visuals effects continue to be wonderful and the practical settings are beautiful, once again, there is a lot less CGI than you probably think. Excellent cinematography and the John Williams' score induces enormous levels of nostalgia and excitement. The action sequences are mind-blowing, the stunt work is phenomenal and there are tons of pure epic and awesome scenes.

The main plot includes a very dark and mysterious side to it that I thoroughly love. A lot of unexpected twists and turns make The Last Jedi more original than The Force Awakens, even if one or two plot points might be underwhelming, and it also has a very well balanced tone. Finally, a thrilling, breathtaking, action-heavy third act ends the film with magnificent glory and with many heartfelt moments.

All in all, Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers something that I can be proud of experiencing. Terrific performances from the cast, but a flawlessly powerful display from Adam Driver as Kylo Ren steals the spotlight. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while I find most of them truly jaw-dropping, a few left me underwhelmed. The main story keeps its obscure mystery while packing some jaw-dropping, epic action sequences and excellent character-development scenes. Nevertheless, it departs from JJ’s visual storytelling, delivering a more exposition-heavy screenplay and some pacing issues bring the movie down, largely due to the unnecessary detour of the subplot involving Finn and Rose. In the end, it still belongs to my top half of the saga, fighting for the 4th spot with Return Of The Jedi and Rogue One.

When four teenagers in detention discover an old video game console with a game they've never heard of, they are immediately thrust into the game's jungle setting, into the bodies of their avatars, played by Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji -Jumanji plays you. They'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, or they'll be stuck in the game forever.



In the age of Hollywood's obsession with franchise-building and reboots, the idea for a sequel to 1995's 'Jumanji' came across as another eye-roll worthy project. However, the combination of charming actors Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillian and Kevin Hart, made it evident that this would wind up either being a complete trainwreck, or total mindless fun. Fortunately, 'Welcome to the Jungle' falls solidly into the latter category. The chemistry between the lead cast is evident and the script makes the most of this by giving each actor moments to shine and showcase their skills while they clearly enjoy playing their characters.

Johnson's younger persona Spencer is a nerdy guy who has lived a sheltered life and is afraid of the world. When he enters the game he takes on the avatar of a hunk with no discernible physical weakness. Johnson has fun with this switch of persona and watching him go back and forth doesn't get old. The same goes for Jack Black who plays a self-absorbed, social media addicted teenage girl Bethany. Her switch into Black's trademark rotund shape is the most extreme and ends up being hilarious. While Black and Johnson are engaging as they are completely cast against their typical selves, Gillian and Hart aren't too far behind playing an awkward, insecure but intelligent girl, and an all-star jock boy trapped in a less-than-stellar body respectively.



This entire body-switch premise works on slapstick humour that's not crass and moves quickly with ample action to ensure that the 2-hour runtime doesn't feel bulky at any point. Granted there's a villain problem with Bobby Cannavale's Van Pelt being as one-dimensional as they come. It's conveniently explained away as this is all a video game, and the same rules apply for its lack of depth. 



_Overall_, 'Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle' ends up being a fun, holiday film that will keep you entertained enough to make it worth your time and money.,The effects have improved (as you'd hope they would over the course of 22 years), but _Welcome to the Jungle_ didn't really do much for me. It completely lacks the charm of the original movie, but also the worldly scope of the animated series. I sat there patiently as weak joke after weak joke bounced off of me ineffectually, but the person I watched it with seemed to be having a great time, so maybe I'm just dead inside?

_Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._,Eh.  This was so-so.  I like the rock so ill give this a 6 out of 10. The original was WAYYYYY better.,***Entertaining adventure/fantasy with a little welcome depth***

Four high school teens in Atlanta – a nerd (Alex Wolff), a muscular football player (Ser'Darius Blain), a shallow “hot blonde” (Madison Iseman) and a brainy, demure redhead (Morgan Turner) – get sucked into a video game and find themselves as avatars – a brawny explorer (Dwayne Johnson), his diminutive zoological sidekick (Kevin Hart), a cartologist / palaeontologist (Jack Black) and a martial arts babe (Karen Gillan). Can they get back alive?  

“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” (2017) is the third film in the current four-film franchise if you include “Zathura: A Space Adventure” (2005). It was a surprise hit at the box office and produced an immediate sequel in 2019.    

While I give the edge to the original 1995 movie, this one delivers the goods for an entertaining family-friendly adventure/fantasy with a good message. The nonsense in the jungle is amusing & thrilling without overstaying its welcome. What really makes the film work is that it effectively establishes the four characters and their situations in the first act and wraps up with showing how they’ve grown as a result of their otherworldly adventure.

Dwayne Johnson is always great for the lead in these kinds of flicks and Hart & Black offer comical support. Karen Gillan is cute and athletic, but needs to gain some weight IMHO. Meanwhile Madison Iseman (Bethany) has alluring eyes, but Morgan Turner (Martha) actually outshines her. The exceptional title song plays during the credits.  

The movie runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in Atlanta, Georgia (neighborhood scenes) and Hawaii with loads of CGI backdrops.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,Phenomenal film. Loved every second.

I've been aware of this film, in name only (didn't know any of the plot etc.), since it came out and have always had a great feeling about it - I just had an inkling it would be great. It isn't, it's much more than that... it's incredible.

The mix between the humour and seriousness is superb, I found myself laughing aloud one moment and then feeling saddened minutes later; that was the case a ridiculous amount of times throughout the 115 minutes.

The premise is pretty mad and filled with coincidences, but I absolutely adore the way it is written and put together onscreen. The cinematography is also beautiful, as is the score. The pacing is fantastic too. All that is without even mentioning the cast, who are outstanding.

What a terrific performance from Frances McDormand, who I always remember from 1998's <em>'Madeline'</em> - one of the first films I recall watching at a young age. She's utterly brilliant as Mildred, from the first scene to the last. Her co-stars are also top notch, so well cast.

Woody Harrelson (Willoughby) and Sam Rockwell (Dixon) are great in their respective roles, while my personal GOT king Peter Dinklage (James) also appears in a minor part. I liked Caleb Landry Jones (Red), also.

But it's really only worth seeing on streaming.This would not be worth seeing in the theatre. It's a mash up of gritty cop drama and Lord of the Rings-style fantasy. It's an interesting concept, but most of the characters are underdeveloped, especially the villains. Only Joel Edgerton's Orc character is a fully fleshed out, compelling character. He is the best thing in the film.,Almost a great film, but the ending lets it down just a bit.

The concept is brilliant: buddy cop + _Lord of the Rings_ sequel. What you'd expect is a somewhat humorous popcorn action flick. Instead, Bright turns out to be quite dark and deep. It's about racial prejudice, for a start. It's about police corruption. It's about hard choices and trusting people you don't like. And, of course, it's about good versus evil.

The Orcs are a stand-in for just about any oppressed minority. It's a clever bit of allegory, if a bit obvious. Less obvious is the portrayal of the Elves, who turn out to be the arrogant, uber-entitled 0.1-percenters. If you always thought the elves in LOTR were a bit snooty, you'll love this switcheroo.

Will Smith is as good as ever, playing an older and more world-weary version of his character from films like _I Robot_. Joel Edgerton is fine as the Orc, and Noomi Rapace seems to have been born to play an evil Elf.

Unfortunately, after a lot of gritty action superbly directed by Ayer, the ending arrives as a bit of an action-movie cliche. There was so much more meat here, in the characters, in the politics, in the weird magical backdrop. I was hoping for a more character-driven ending, instead of the usual mindless brute-force head-bashing (as superbly exemplified by every DC comix movie of recent years).

Nonetheless, Bright is well worth a watch. It fails in some of its higher aspirations, but reverts to being a very entertaining buddy-cop romp. Which isn't so bad.,Ninety nine times out of a hundred, whenever I have a varying opinion with critics at large, I understand how we have both come to our separate opinions and move on with my day. About once a year though, there is a movie where all I can think about the vast majority disliking a movie is: ""This world is fucking crazy"". The last time it happened was with _Chappie_, and today, it happened again with _Bright_.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,Everything about Bright is a true achievement in being terrible. For a movie with a very interesting world and a cool premise, Max Landis and David Ayer and the cast managed to create true dog shit. The largest problem lays with Landis's terrible script with some of the worst dialog I have ever heard and Will Smith's acting and (what I can only assume to be) ad-libbing. Every single actor/actress does a terrible job, but I pin at least half of that on Landis. All of the dialog is so stilited and the general plot is so full of holes, so slow and bogged down with nonsense, and incredibly ham-fisted with it's obtuse social commentary. Will Smith is a real actor who has real acting skills, he has two Emmy nominations and five Golden Globe nominations, and although there are a few bad spots on his IMDB page, he usually does a fine job. His performance in Bright is essentially just Will Smith being Will Smith who exclusively speaks in pop culture references (which raise a few questions about the world of Bright [Shrek exists in a world where humans and orcs have lived together for thousands of years?]) and curse words. I guess no one wanted to make Will Smith mad so they let him make whatever stupid quips he wants, but it becomes clear that no one making this film gives half a fuck. As bad as the script and plot are (which is a true testament to Landis's ability to punish the audience) it's almost possible to overlook how terrible the the CG and fight choreography are. The explosions and blood spray are below Windows Movie Maker quality and big fight pieces make no sense and are incredibly lazy and confusing. This movie is so stupid that it can't even follow its own rules. Suspension of disbelief only works when the movie works within its own world. Every 15 minutes, Bright does something that either makes no sense or defies the rules it created. I won't go into it much of it to not spoil anything, but a big part of the movie is the hunt for and protection of a magic wand. In Bright's world, only a ""bright"" can even hold a magic wand. If any non-bright touches a wand, they instantly explode. There is apparently no way to know if someone is a bright or not is to grab a wand and see if you blow up or not and they make it seem like brights are rare. So, given this, why does everyone seem to think that they are a bright and try and grab the wand? One minor character even manages to and even though they don't become a burst of goo, there is no way it makes sense for them to be a bright. Bright makes no sense and is easily one of the worst movies I have seen. From a technical stand point, the camera work is fine, the sets are fine, the sound equipment works and was mixed properly, but this is only place Bright can get any points. It's stupid. It's stupid, and dumb, and it makes no sense. I usually disagree with the opinion of the media critics 95% of the time, but I have to agree with them here. I like lame Sci-Fi, Action, and Fantasty movies; I legitimately like Suicide Squad (David Ayer and Will Smith's previous collaboration) and I get nothing positive out of Bright.

At the end of the day _The Shape of Water_, at its most stripped back, is a movie about fucking a fish. But it's the kind of movie about fucking a fish that should also probably win the Academy Award for Best Picture.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,GDT's first truly great flick. The R-Rated Family Movie schtick always came off as silly or had a story too dull to carry its own weight. Characters and morality are two dimensional; the world functions via cartoon logic. But the love story here is precious. Could be argued it's an apologist film for zoophilia, considering the amphibian shows little intelligence beyond that of a dog.,Bend me, shape me, anyway you want me!

Guillermo del Toro directs and co-writes with Vanessa Taylor what would turn out to be the Best Picture Academy Award Winner for 2017. A much loved film that's not without dissention in certain quarters, it's a picture that warrants dissention but it should be noted that just because someone doesn't like it, that doesn't make it a bad film. I'm certainly in the camp that finds it over praised, even annoyingly disappointing, whilst appreciating many of the facets within its production.

Story in simple terms is a Beauty and the Beast like fable where Sally Hawkins' mute cleaning lady Elisa Esposito falls in love with a captured Amphibian Man. Amphibian Man is known by the government types as The Asset, and as the Cold War rises and 60s paranoia takes a hold, the American big wigs want to vivisect the special species to learn from it. Elisa, after courting ""The Asset"", enlists the help of close friends and plots to free the creature from its captivity in the underground medical bunker labyrinth place.

Now as simple as that sounds, there is more to it than that, del Toro and Taylor whilst enveloping the pic in a fantasy realm feel, ensure messages are thrust hard at the viewers. Be it the racial disharmony, the quest for different walks of life finding love with each other, the cry for humans to stop being bad and killing things because they don't understand them, torture is evil and etc etc. It's all right there in your face and we get it. So plot maybe simple but for sure there's a lot being said in the narrative.

Yet as great as it looks, and it's superbly acted by Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer, it just to me loses its way come the mid-point, getting daft and even getting a little icky into the bargain. I have no problem with improbabilities and outrageous contrivances here, this is del Toro painting one of his fantastical worlds - only on Earth in the early 60s! But the pay off is poor, hinging on a twist that's not only ridiculous, but insulting as well because otherwise the pic would be very troubling indeed. No art deco eye orgasms or vibrant characterisations can compensate for a film that runs out of steam.

That said, I was glad to have watched it, there's even a possibility I could return to it in the future - this is very good film making. But it's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination and not for the first time in the Academy's long history, many are baffled by their choice of Best Picture winner. 6/10,","cold war,baltimore,fairy tale,government,supernatural,laboratory,orphan,bathtub,scientist,capture,sign languages,1960s,fishman,amphibious creature,",42,95,"Guillermo del Toro,"

When yet another remake of Murder on the Orient express came out I was somewhat hesitant. After all, the one with David Suchet was perfect.

I guess I was right to be hesitant. This is another one of those remakes where you just wonder…why? As a movie it is not too bad but as a Hercule Poirot movie, the classical Murder on the Orient Express no less, it is like buying a piece of prime filet of beef and discovering that the butcher gave you chicken drums when you open the package. Edible but not at all what you paid for.

To me this movie was a blatant attempt to make an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. It was poorly done by a clueless scriptwriter and director and it was deeply disrespectful to the original character.

The movie starts of by introducing Hercule as the pedantic, somewhat weird, person that he is but the attempt is just dumb and silly. Apart from the scene more or less making Hercule look like a jerk, these people apparently know him, why would they serve two eggs of different sizes in the first place? Oh right, because the director thought the audience was too dumb to make that reflection.

Then there are some things that Hercule simply do not do. Like walking on the roofs of train cars, climbing around and chasing criminals as if he was some action hero. He even gets shot and more or less just shrugs it off for Christ sake!

And do not get me started on that grotesque moustache! As I said, an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. Unfortunately bigger is not always better.

I can go on for some time here so let’s move on.

Technically the movie is not that bad. The scenes, the decor, the acting in general etc. can even be said to be good. Unfortunately, for me, this was constantly overshadowed by the brutal slaughtering of my beloved Hercule Poirot character.

Part of this is probably due to the movie trying to focus so much on Hercule that most of the other actors almost feel like … props, even though they themselves are doing quite a good job of their roles. One reviewer wrote that “The actors seem to have been invited, not to play characters, but to watch Kenneth Branagh act.” and there seems to be some truth in that.

The movie ends with a hint of further moves. Personally, I hope there will not be a continuation of this train wreck (pun intended).,","venice, italy,detective,based on novel or book,europe,professor,orient express,knife,investigation,princess,remake,murder,thriller,snow,whodunit,train,stabbing,alps mountains,murder mystery,1930s,steam train,",35,121,"Kenneth Branagh,"

Churchill with Brian Cox in the lead role is a FAR superior film on the subject.,As with many of the biopics I've seen recently, _Darkest Hour_ is more focussed on delivering you the facts than getting you involved with the characters. It is an interesting idea to have the majority of the story revolve around the of whether or not to sue for peace. That as a core concept in so much as the question of ""Do I take the guarantee of saving my country or do I take the risk of saving the world?"" and beyond that ""Is there even a right answer to that question? And who am I to decide something this big?"" is a great philosophical centre for a movie. But I never felt like I knew why any of these people had the answers that they gave. I get that in a historical context, these aren't characters they are real life people, so they answers they had are the answers we see, but again, we are only given the _what_, not the _why_.

Rosamund Pike plays a grieving settler that the detail picks up on the way. Rory Cochrane plays Sgt. Metz and Jonathan Majors Corp. Woodsen. 

While the flick starts great and the Western ""road movie"" plot is full of potential, some elements are too contrived/unlikely (e.g. the whole fur trapper episode) or wannabe heavy (e.g. Sgt. Metz' apology in the rain) and the film just wallows in unrelenting glumness. Still, there is some good in it and you’ll discern a glimmer here or there. It's just that after the excellent set-up, I thought I was in for a great Western, but it wasn't to be. The script needed serious rewriting.

GRADE: C/C- (4.5/10),_Four Weddings and a Funeral Except the Weddings Were Actually Just Extra Funerals._

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._,I've killed everything that's walked or crawled. If you do it enough, you get used to it.

Hostiles is directed by Scott Cooper and Cooper adapts the screenplay from the story written by Donald E. Stewart. It stars Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, Wes Studi, Rory Cochrane, John Benjamin Hickey, Jeremiah Wilks and Jesse Plemons. Music is by Max Richter and cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi.

In 1892, legendary Capt. Joseph J. Blocker (Bale) reluctantly has to escort his old Cheyenne adversary Chief Yellow Hawk (Studi) and his family through dangerous territories. The aim is to get them to the Cheyenne tribal homelands of Montana so Yellow Hawk can get his wish to die in peace. 

Where we at these days with the grand old bastion of American cinema, the Western? The only real constant is that thankfully for lovers of the form there are new directors willing to tackle the genre and bring something to the newer generations. Here we have Scott Cooper, who right from the off hasn’t hid the fact that Hostiles is his rallying call for a better world, or at least a better understanding of different cultures. What better way to cry out than to do it in a Western, using the Indian Wars as the backdrop. Perfect really.

Hostiles jumps right out of the blocks to grab you by the throat with soul shattering violence, with Cooper and his team initially facing charges of old by fronting up a one sided argument – but there is more. Quickly a switch ensures that both sides of this particular bloody coin have been tossed, scene set for what will follow. A meeting back at Fort Berringer where Captain Blocker receives the orders he simply doesn’t want to obey is in hushed tones, yet the words being spoken are brutally loud and to the point. And on to the journey, damaged souls unbound who not only have to fear hostiles from outside their group, but the hostiles within it and within themselves.

As the story moves through the journey undertaken by our protagonists, the makers have not cut corners with the characterisations, the emotional development of the principals is one of the film’s strengths (cast are superb, there’s a real authenticity to their respective performances). Also worthy is the pacing, it is deliberately unhurried and allows the characters to breathe, it also gives the jolts of action more potency, whilst simultaneously we can absorb the stunning landscapes (New Mexico/Arizona) and rejoice at the pleasures of an outdoor Western.  While how nice it is to have a musical score that doesn’t blunderbuss the important sequences, rounding out what is a top technical production.

There’s some irritants here, though, so it’s not perfect, and this is before it is marked poorly by those not in sync with the messages of the piece. Ben Foster turns up as Philip Wills, a most edgy character that makes one wish there was far more of him in the pic, for as it is it ends up feeling a bit pointless since he only emphasises what we have learned about Blocker at the start. Then there’s a key turn of events for the story’s  coup de grâce that leaves a frustrating taste in the mouth, not as a film killer or even close in fact, but it should have gone another way one feels. Especially given the two sides of the argument stance Cooper and co had began with.

Yet this is for Western fans a real treat, following in the footsteps of new era classics like Dances With Wolves and Unforgiven, Hostiles may have a new age sensibility in its narrative thrust, but traditionally old age adultness propels it forward. 9/10,","montana,new mexico,chief,native american,native american reservation,bigotry,19th century,indigenous peoples,new mexico territory,",36,102,"Scott Cooper,"

The film settled on a style and tone that falls somewhere around the Coen brothers territory, but also gave me Christopher Guest vibes with its talking head moments and Paul Thomas Anderson level soundtrack use. It had a lot of cinematic elements, but overall it's a super accessible crowd pleaser.

There are two big problems I have with this film, however. Its soundtrack, while filled to the brim with classic songs, often felt out of place or completely unnecessary at times. For an iconic 90s story, having only 70s songs was an interesting choice. A lot of the songs played at strange moments as well and sometimes they were just too on-the-nose. For example, Supertramp's ""Goodbye Stranger"" plays as Jeff and Tonya separate for the first time. The other problem with this film involves the inclusion of the fourth wall breaking moments. This happens maybe 10 times throughout the film, but it didn't add anything and in fact distracted me from the story when it happened.

That said, what's great about this movie is how *truly* funny it is. I was expecting a few laughs because of the ridiculousness of the story, but the comedy here was really smart. It plays like a crime-gone-wrong Fargo-esque tale in its latter half and it works this way really well. The performances are strong especially from the always good Allison Janney (who is a huge scene stealer) and Margot Robbie. I've never seen Robbie give a performance like this before and I consider this her first big, meaty roll that allows her to use all of the acting bones in her body. She's funny, charming, brash, and you can tell she really committed herself to this role. Very impressed.,Fantastic feel-good story with an anti-establishment vibe. The movie challenges your interpretation of the events at the time, and has several sobering moments (oj news coverage, tonya spitting blood). Also funny as all get out.,With the Oscars only a week away and the 2018 Winter Olympics on right now, it seemed like the appropriate time to finally watch _I, Tonya_, the movie for which lead Margot Robbie has received her first ""Best Actress"" Academy Award nomination.

2017 has had a lot of biopics, and a good number of those garnered awards buzz/consideration, and for all of them, I had (to varying degrees) the same complaint: They're to much about the ""what"" and not enough about the ""who"". _I, Tonya_ bucks that trend completely, and gives us a movie in which I felt I truly got to know these characters. Now how accurate those ""characters"" are to their real life counterparts is another discussion for another time, but contained within the movie itself, I was very satisfied with the insight I got in _American Ice Skater Story_.

You can easily tell that everybody is trying their hardest to portray these characters. Some of them came across as real-life people while others just felt like characters in a movie. This could mainly be pointed to the writing in this film. Some of the lines in this film were just hilariously bad and cringy and I would give examples but I already forgot them. But I do have to say the scenery was stunning and the production on this was well done. Each set and costume looked perfect for each scene. The costumes fit each character and showed a bit more into their personality. For example, Richard’s outfits made him look like royalty but at the same time, a normal guy because that’s what he wants to be. This film had lots of pacing issues. From beginning to end it didn’t feel like that was the speed it should be going at. The beginning felt slow while the ending felt to fast. The creators of the film might have thought they had a longer film and then realized they only had a one hour and thirty-two-minute film so they had to quickly resolve the film. The last thing I want to talk about is the relationship in this film. It’s not believable or relatable. I know it shouldn’t be relatable seeing how it is about a journalist falling in love with a prince but the writers still should make it so some people can relate to at least one of them. And it isn’t believable because it seems too rushed. Throughout the entire film, they are hardly around each other and then all of a sudden he just loves her. There is no explanation why just little subtle hints. In the end, A Christmas Prince is perfect for people who like RomComs but for others not so much. I give A Christmas Prince a 6/10.,","prince,romance,woman journalist,christmas,interclass romance,",21,26,"Alex Zamm,"

RELEASED IN 2017 and directed by Benny Fine, ""F the Prom” is a campy high school dramedy about two inseparable neighbor-friends, Cole (Joel Courtney) and Maddy (Danielle Campbell), who separate when they enter high school wherein Cole is relentlessly teased while Maddy becomes the most popular girl. When they reunite two and a half years later, they scheme to destroy the Prom (the ultimate teen popularity contest) teamed with a ragtag gang of outcasts.

There are a lot of 1 Star votes (out of 10) of this movie on IMDb, which is absurd. While this may be a low-budget teen flick, it’s not THAT bad. Many of these critics lament how unrealistic the movie is, which is ridiculous in light of its campy tone. It would be like criticizing the 60’s Batman TV show for being unrealistic. In other words, there’s a lot of silliness and exaggerations in “F the Prom,” but it’s intentional. Underneath it all, the movie reflects several real-life issues, mostly pertaining to popularity and the drive to be liked. Others argue that the point is elusive and characters contradict themselves. No, the point(s) are obvious and some characters change their minds because they’re fickle teens.

This is a solid low-budget high school flick, but it’s a little too talky for my tastes. And I guess the staple “gay” character is here to stay at this juncture, but the movie wins points for boldly illustrating that even gays have their cliques and shun those who don’t conform.

Campbell and Madelaine Petsch are solid on the female front, but the director could’ve showcased their beauty better (and I’m not talking about nudity). Meg DeLacy is intelligent & winsome as Stuft (aka City) and has a beautiful face, but needs to gain some curves.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal. WRITERS: The Fine Brothers and Molly Prather.

GRADE: C,F The Prom? F This Film! High school prom. A seemingly rather important and colossal event of a student’s educational career for friends across the pond. Here, it’s not so much a big deal. We formally dress up, stand awkwardly whilst our parents take photos and attempt to enjoy the evening by patiently waiting for it to end. The Fine Brothers, of ‘React’ YouTube video fame, yearned to convey the significance of such an event through an insight into modern day schools, where students are more concerned about popularity and Instagram followers instead of the legitimate grading system. Where fathers are more inclined to spur their sons into getting laid, and teachers couldn’t give a toss about their jobs. Hyperbolised unrealistic bullying, where the teachers also join in laughing, to showcase victimisation and how the pressured can overcome their peers by staging a ‘Carrie’ remake at prom.

I’m sure the Fine Brothers just wanted to make a “relatable” high school comedy, yet somehow produced the most toxic piece of glorification that is dangerous more than entertaining. Literally the most disagreeable “film” (more like a super-extended YouTube clip) I’ve seen. Let’s dissect.

The writing is problematic with every line spoken. Issues that should not be joked about, are definitely tackled here, to which the intended audience are young impressionable teens. Anti-semitism, revenge porn, homophobia, misogyny, speech impediments, paedophilic comments from the frickin’ school principal as she flashes her cleavage to all the students. Drugging colleagues, misusing selfies, tarnishing ‘The Breakfast Club’, ruining Courtney’s career after ‘Super 8’ and generally being insensitive. If the target here was to offend everyone, well, mission accomplished!

In what planet does a father try to convince their son to quickly have sex at prom? In what galaxy does the school principal shout “use a condom, or pull out!”? In what universe does a “popular” girl spout “moments like this should be unfiltered”? F off! My cringe capacity is shattered beyond repair.

No school year would remember derogatory nicknames, such as “tighty” or “sweats”, three years since whatever incident occurred. I farted once in a geography lesson, I couldn’t hold it in so you can’t blame me! The class laughed for the entire lesson, including the teacher. Naturally, I was embarrassed. But my classmates at the time didn’t bring it up and make fun of me three years later!? That’s just fabricated unrealism so that the Fine Bros could hone in on the “popularity ruins unpopular kids’ feelings” message. But when those unpopular kids then bully those that are deemed popular, the message dissipates. It’s gone. Vanished. F’d off back to the underworld or wherever bad scripts end up. The studio shredder, probably.

Do people still talk in abbreviations like “TTYL”, “BRB” and “LOL”? I thought we moved on from that as an intelligent species. I needn’t comment on the mediocre acting that resembled a Disney Channel original feature. Nor the noticeable foundation on everyone’s face so that all the pubescent acne is covered up. I was honestly waiting for this to turn into a musical, where they brutally murder original songs including “Gays Are Bad”, “Selfies First, Questions Later” and “My Dad Wants Me To F You Right Now, Not The Prom”.

It’s clear this is written by a middle-aged man trying ever so hard to relate to the current generation of teens. It can be done. I’ve seen it done! Yet the Fine Bros managed to insult nearly everyone in the process, by transforming an innocent school comedy into an unfunny manipulative piece of derogative toxicity. Not only is it one of the worst films I’ve had the displeasure of watching, it’s near unwatchable. Heck, I was offended myself. Anyway, G2G and cancel my Netflix subscription so that I’m not tempted by F-ing rubbish like this again. LMFAO. ROFLCOPTER. FML.,Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

To be fair, there isn't anything super special about this, but it's of good quality.  It's a ""girl next door"", ""mean girls"", ""revenge on the popular clique"" mix of tropes.

The acting, writing, and production quality are all decent, and I particularly like Madelaine Petsch's mean girl portrayal.

It's really awkward because I don't really have any big complaints, nor anything to rave about.

After spending 130 minutes totally immersed in the world of 1950s high fashion, I felt like an utter rube walking out of the cinema in my jeans and hoody combo.

Phantom Thread is as immersive as cinema gets. From its opening sequence, which takes us inside the House of Woodcock, a London fashion house run in quietly tyrannical fashion by renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day Lewis), Anderson's film dismisses any thoughts we might have of our own world of 2018. As we witness Reynolds go about his daily grooming routine it becomes clear we're watching a movie about a perfectionist, one made by a perfectionist, and starring a perfectionist in what is reputedly his final acting role.

Set in his ways like a tree set in concrete, Reynolds knows what he likes, and he likes what he knows. As such, his relationships with the many admiring members of the opposite sex (the film is set at a time when no man was more attractive than one who made things; and if those things happened to make women feel beautiful, like Reynolds' gowns, all the better) rarely get past the following morning's breakfast, where idle chit chat and toast buttering irritate him to a laughably over the top degree.

It's during breakfast away from home, in a small country café, that Reynolds meets Alma (Vicky Krieps), a pretty Eastern European waitress who is won over by his flirtatious charm and accepts his invitation for a dinner date. The relationship blooms quickly and Reynolds invites her into his home, teaching her the ways of his trade.

It doesn't take long for Alma's ways to begin annoying the fiercely independent and somewhat narcissistic Reynolds, and her presence begins to disrupt his work - she's become an anti-muse! Reynolds' assumption that she will follow the other women in his past and leave quietly once exposed to his spoilt brat boorishness couldn't be more wrong however. Alma is determined to make the relationship work, even if she has to take extreme measures.

Read the rest of Eric Hillis's review at http://www.themoviewaffler.com/2018/01/new-release-review-phantom-thread.html,I saw _Phantom Thread_ as part of a trio. We began watching this Oscar nominated movie at staggered intervals. I, from the beginning. The second, a half hour in. Then her partner, just past the half-way point. But all of us came to the same reaction when we'd been watching for what seemed like days only to realise there was still 30 minutes left: Lying on the cold, dirty floor, begging for it to end.

Prepare for the most heterosexual thing I have ever said: We had to watch YouTube clips of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie-kills and then the whole original _Robocop_ as a palette cleanser after being forced to endure _Phantom Thread_.

Let me start off by saying this film is not about terrorists striking in the US but about home grown terrorist in Germany, specifically Hamburg. It is there that Katja (Diane Kruger) is married to Kurdish immigrant Nuri Sekerci (Numan Acar). The pair also have a 5 year old son named Rocco. Nuri runs a business that helps new immigrants translate various documents to help them and one day Katja drops off their son there while she visits with one of her friends. As she leaves she bumps into a young woman who left her bike nearby unchained.

As she returns home that evening she finds the road she takes past the office blocked off and flashing police lights illuminating the buildings. Stopping she gets out of the car and runs to find the office building blown apart. Someone has exploded a bomb outside and both Nuri and Rocco were instantly killed.

Katja is torn by the event and is doing all she can not to lose control. Her friend and parents come to stay with her and keep an eye on her. Going out one night she contacts her friend and lawyer and he provides her with drugs she takes to deal with her inner pain, drugs one of his clients left. The lawyer worked for both her and Nuri, helping when years before when Nuri was a drug dealer. Having a child changed all that and Nuri and Katja had remained clean for years.

She tells the police all about the girl she saw and the investigation moves forward. But rather than dig for the truth the police seem more focused on Nuri as an immigrant and potential terrorists himself. Noting his past record they check the house out and find her drugs but the officer in charge lets her off the hook. Still, their focus remains on Islamic terrorists ignoring the description of the girl she gave them. Until someone else gives her up.

It turns out the pair responsible for the bombing were neo-Nazis, André (Ulrich Brandhoff) and Edda Möller (Hanna Hilsdorf). With evidence in hand the prosecutor charges them and the trial proceeds. This becomes a fascinating part of the film showing how differently the cases are handled there than here. Each day Katja must face the discussion of the deaths of her loved ones, certain in her own mind that these were the two that destroyed her family.

The question rises as the trial progresses just how far the defense is willing to go. All of the past is brought up to steer the focus away from the defendants. The defense also makes an attempt at discounting the evidence that was found in the home of André's father, the man responsible for calling in the police and leading to their arrest. It isn't certain whether this line of defense will play out in favor of the defendants or in favor of Katja. But finding justice and finding revenge are two different things to consider.

The movie is well made and acted with Kruger turning in yet another great performance. She is center stage here from start to finish, the entire film revolving are her character. This is a complex character not prone to hysterics all the time but unraveling due to her circumstances as the film progresses. Kruger makes her believable and the pain she releases is tangible at times.

The movie is definitely a depressing tale to follow and it moves along with ups and downs as it moves forward. And while Kruger does a tremendous job I felt it difficult to get involved too deep with the character and her predicament. Still it was an interesting film to watch and worth taking a look at.

Acting was A+, Human emotion was A+ but do not mix who is who with what is what for that Kurds are not Turks. If you read Greek history for the past 600 years, you know what is what. Bringing in the Nazis in this is just a way to distort viewers perception of what is evil.,**_Disappointingly shallow_**

> _In Germany, we have serious issues with the rise of neo-Nazis, and how they've - neo-Nazis and racists - now reached the centre of society. In the Nineties, you could see the enemy. They were skinheads, and they were idiots, and violent. But what are they wearing now? What do they look like and how do they talk? Now, they are very smart. We had the so-called NSU killings. Between 2000 and 2007, a group of three neo-Nazis, two men and one woman, killed ten people. Nine immigrants - eight with Turkish or Kurdish background, one with Greek background - and one_ _German police officer. And until 2011, the police, the society, and the press thought these murders were done by the Turkish mafia. Just because the victims were all killed with the same gun, and they were Turkish, people said, ""_These must have been drug dealers, or they must have something to do with prostitution_."" That's the racism of the society. In November 2011, it came out that these killings were done by this group. And it came out by random - not because of a successful police investigation._

Fatih Akin, the writer and director of _Aus dem nichts_ [lit. trans. _From Nothing_] is a political individual; he makes political films and he makes political statements in his personal life. Akin identifies as a German-Turk; he was born in Hamburg, but his parents are both Turkish, having come to Germany with the first wave of Turkish immigrants following the _Wirtschaftswunder_ of the fifties and sixties. He lives and works in Germany, and although almost all of his films are set there (the notable exception is _The Cut_), and all have German-funding, he considers himself a Turkish filmmaker. When he won Best Screenplay for _Auf der anderen Seite_ at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, he accepted the award ""_on behalf of Turkish cinema_."" Easily the best known/most notorious of his political statements, however, was in 2006 when he was photographed wearing a t-shirt with the word ""BU卐H"" on it (the ""S"" replaced by a swastika). Displaying a swastika in public is against the law in Germany, and after a complaint was made, he was investigated (but not charged) by German police. He later defended the shirt, stating,

I'm convinced the Bush administration wants a third world war. I think they're fascists [...] You can apply irony to something like that. You can redefine the symbol in a politically correct horizon. My T-shirt is more than mere provocation. You have to look into the context. The swastika is not there on its own, but as part of the word 'BUSH.' One would have to be pretty stupid, not to understand that._

In short, this is not a guy afraid to speak his mind.

Akin's main political preoccupation in his filmography, however, is not Nazism or American presidents, it's the experience of Turkish immigrants in Germany, specifically the racism often directed towards them, racism which is oftentimes found masquerading as patriotism. It is unknown how many Turks are actually in Germany, as the German census doesn't allow people to record their ethnicity, but as of 2011, there were 2.7 million inhabitants with at least one Turkish parent. However, academic estimates suggest there be as many as 7 million Turks, or people identifying as Turks, in the country. Now, with that many people of a different nationality in a country, problems are going to arise (just ask the British), and this is where Akin focuses a great deal of his energies. Everything from _Solino_ (2002) to _Gegen die Wand_ (2004) to _Auf der anderen Seite_ (2007) to _Soul Kitchen_ (2009) has political DNA derived from the experience of racism in Germany.

So, with that in mind, _Nichts_ (co-written with Hark Bohm) doesn't jump off the page as a typical Akin film - when former convicted drug dealer Nuri Sekerci (Numan Acar) and his son are killed in a bomb blast at his office, his wife Katja (Diane Kruger) has faith that the police and courts will find and punish those responsible. However, as Katja finds herself becoming more and more disillusioned with the systems which are supposed to be on her side, she comes to believe she must take things into her own hands. Read like that, this could be any number of bad Hollywood movies (F. Gary Gray's wonderfully risible _Law Abiding Citizen_ (2009) springs to mind). However, when we include the fact that Nuri is Turkish, and that the police quickly come to suspect the bombing may have been connected to a Neo-Nazi group, it fits much more comfortably into his _oeuvre_. Unfortunately, it's not very good.

First of all, the film is rigidly divided into an intentionally artificial three-act structure, with each act given its own title (""The Family"", ""The Trial"", and ""The Sea"") and introduction by way of home-movie footage. One of the most significant problems with the film is that the acts simply don't yoke. The first is a pretty decent study of grief, the second is a rather dull courtroom drama, and the third is a bizarrely hollow (and irritatingly repetitive) investigation into the morality of revenge. The last act mirrors the first in its use of slow pacing, long shots of people not doing very much, and sparse dialogue (as opposed to the very wordy second act), and while this is interesting in setting the narrative up in the first act, it falls flat in the third, as the whole thing ends up coming across as rather po-faced and self-important; a film convinced of its own profundity. For all that, however, up until the conclusion, I was thinking I would give it three stars; it's entertaining enough, in a fairly disposable way. But then the bottom falls out. The last scene itself is actually pretty good. It's what happens next that irritated me.

This has not been an especially political film - the Neo-Nazi storyline barely features; a few mentions by police in the first act, a single scene in the second, and a couple of short scenes in the third. That's it. As Katja is the only character who is really given any degree of agency, the Neo-Nazi characters are little more than background extras (in fact, in some scenes, they are _literally_ background extras). So this is not a film which spends a lot of time delving into issues of racism in Germany or offering insight into the rise of Right-Wing Populism across Europe. It's a revenge drama. However, as it ends, a legend appears on-screen informing the audience how many race crimes are committed against Turks in Germany each year. The film has absolutely not, by any stretch of the imagination, earned the right to preach to the audience in this way. It's almost as if Akin forgot he was trying to make something political, only remembering in time to throw together a vaguely worded statement on the sufferings of his people in an effort to give the audience something to think about. It doesn't work, with the statement serving only to trivialise the issue by trying to tie it to a film in which it barely featured, and it leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.,","germany,revenge,marijuana,racism,terrorist bombing,bomb attack,",20,26,"Fatih Akin,"

It feels so good to see James Roday and Dule Hill back in style. It just feels so right. Unfortunately, Timothy Omundson suffered a stroke before filming began and was subjected to a short cameo but it still felt like the gang was all back together. As usual, _Psych the Movie_ is filled with all sorts of cameos from John Cena to Jimmi Simpson, who played characters in the show and it's a breath of fresh air to see them bundled into one.
Essentially the film picks up a few years after the show ends and it's back on track again with Shawn and Gus's one slap wit banter that goes back and forth to their side conversations that leads to everyone else's distraction. It feels just like home. Hopefully this isn't the end for our fun and play friends as there's definitely enough here to warrant a sequel. And hopefully, the boys behind the typewriter agree.,The reviews for Psych: The Movie are mostly positive. I agree that it was a good reunion film, better than expected. It contains a lot of the things that made the TV series successful, but did not overdo them.

It had a good musical score, which added to the story telling. Timothy Omundson as Carlton ""Lassie"" Lassiter had a stroke just before shooting began, so his role was reduced to a one-minute cameo. (Omundson was outstanding in the short-lived Galavant series.)

All of the scenes between Dulé Hill as Burton ""Gus"" Guster and his real-life fiance, Jazmyn Simon as Selene, were well-written and hilariously performed. By contrast, James Roday and Maggie Lawson were reportedly dating during the entire run of the TV series, from 2006 to 2014. I always felt that their on-screen romance was forced by scripts. I never believed that their characters would be romantically involved. As the TV movie unfolds, their characters are still not married, and she is cold to him.

Kurt Fuller as recurring medical examiner Woody Strode was funny throughout. They gave him a lot of good lines, and used him in scenes where you normally would not see him. Kirsten Nelson as Chief Karen Vick was given more to do than usual. Corbin Bernsen as Henry Spencer was used mainly for comic relief. 

Zachary Levi as Thin White Duke demonstrated that he is a good actor who can perform any role well. The dream sequence, written by James Roday, hilariously indicates that it's a dream. The script pays tribute to at least three celebrities who died recently. The use of Robert LaSardo as El Proveedor was inspired writing, and he gave an outstanding performance, the highlight of the TV-film.

Surprisingly, the story did not unfold with the usual speech by Shawn Spencer solving the case. Juliet ""Jules"" O'Hara was more crucial to resolving things..An epilogue indicates that another Psych TV movie can be expected.,",,20,14,"Steve Franks,"

Comparing this film to “Pan’s Labyrinth” or even “The Monkey’s Paw” is not unfair, both in terms of how the story is told and the general theme, that of escaping into fantasy to distance oneself from the horrors of the world, and of being careful what you wish for. The imagery is not quite as fantastical as “Pan’s Labyrinth” and is actually more akin to that of a modern horror film than a fantasy epic.

The acting is decently done, especially for a movie that focuses primarily on the children. You can feel an enormous uncertainty expressed by these kids, which matches the feeling of children being cast out into the world on their own with no idea where to go or what to do. At the same time, watching what these kids go through is not easy.

This can be a difficult film with challenging themes and imagery. I know that there are some out there that may not be able to stomach some of the themes and events depicted, so be warned. But if you can, it’s a rewarding experience, which is a testament to the film and the talents of those involved. If the audience doesn’t FEEL a film like this, then it wouldn’t be worth your time. With the kind of emotion this film invokes, though, it’s definitely a must see, in my opinion.,","gun,drug crime,fairy tale,tiger,murder,violence,cell phone,street children,mexican cartel,victim's ghost,orphans,",8,33,"Issa López,"

I just wanted to have the person under my complete control, to do with as I wanted. It's not easy to say that, but that's what the motive was._

- Jeffrey Dahmer; speaking to Stone Phillips; _Dateline NBC_ (March 8, 1994)

Taking place over the course of Jeffrey Dahmer's last year in high school, and culminating with the fateful meeting between Dahmer (Ross Lynch) and Steven Hicks (Dave Sorboro), writer/director Marc Meyers's _My Friend Dahmer_ is based on the 2012 graphic novel by Derf Backderf (played in the film by Alex Wolff), who attended the same school as Dahmer, and formed a pseudo-friendship with him. The film is tonally brilliant, coming across like _The Breakfast Club_ (1985) directed by David Fincher, perfectly capturing 80s tackiness. Narratively, however, it's extremely plodding, and could easily have been trimmed by 20 minutes.

It's also difficult to see what Meyers was trying to achieve; other than a couple of brief moments, we're never given any real access to Dahmer's interiority, so he remains an enigma, always at arm's length (which could have been the point). But is Meyers asking us to feel sympathy for Dahmer because he had a difficult adolescence, came from a broken home, couldn't make friends in school; to quote that great line from Michael Mann's _Manhunter_ (1986),

> _my heart bleeds for him, as a child. Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster. At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable. He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies. As an adult, someone should blow the sick fuck out of his socks._

Or is this simply a character study (if we didn't know it was about Dahmer, it could be any number of examinations of high school awkwardness)?

The lack of clarity regarding the film's theme is compounded by the scenes where it looks as if Dahmer is about to murder someone, only to stop at the last second. This is an especially strange way to generate tension, insofar as we already know his first murder was Hicks. Also, if the film is actually trying to say something of societal worth regarding serial killers, directionless youth, nature vs. nurture etc, trying to draw an audience into the narrative with the prospect of murder probably isn't the way to go about it. The film also fails to really get into the issues of Dahmer's sexuality, and his confusion and frustration about being gay. It's worth a look, and Lynch's performance is quite something, but if you're already familiar with Dahmer's story, you won't find much insight here.,","1970s,ohio,biography,high school,based on a true story,based on comic,sociopath,murder,male homosexuality,coming of age,serial killer,divorce,based on graphic novel,social outcast,",39,29,"Marc Meyers,"

Before I get started let me just say that angst and anger are not the same thing.  I have read so many reviews that have described the character of Leah as angst-ridden.  Angst is fear or anxiety, often about the future, it is not the same thing as anger...

Leah is a teen living with her grieving mother.  She likes black metal and the occult.  She's not completely off the rails, still respects her mother, but she is clearly dealing with the loss of her father as is her mother.  Her mum decides it is time to uproot from the family home and shift to a cabin in the woods.  After a massive argument the angry teen summons a demon/witch/entity to kill her mum, and spends the rest of the film regretting and trying to reverse the ritual.

There's some good acting, some nicely fleshed out characters with a lot of grey moral areas, no one is completely good or completely bad.  The mother is simultaneously cold, selfish, distant, loving, caring and concerned.  The daughter is angry, upset, respectful and loving.  

The witch is a little like the shark in jaws, all subtle out of focus, with only the odd decent look at it.  That is both a good and a bad thing.  Fans of horror might feel let down, but fans of thrillers might think it is all a little too much

There are some monumentally bad decisions which are hard to get over, and the ending lacked some punch, but it is mostly a well made quiet film.

Surly goth teenagers dabbling in the occult have become a horror movie cliché, but with Adam MacDonald's follow-up to his excellent debut Backcountry, it is an effective and compelling slow burn. With great performances from the leads (including Laurie Holden of The Mist and The Walking Dead), it explores what happens when a troubled teen follows up on her darkest wish. The final act is creepy and disturbing even though it comes to an abrupt end too early leaving us wanting more.,","witch,cabin,widow,black magic,high school,woods,murder,independent film,teenage girl,attic,occult ritual,devil worship,mother daughter relationship,evil spell,",11,58,"Adam MacDonald,"

It's December, so TV channels are flooded with Christmas films. But this is not my first Christmas film of the season. And Hallmark films are easily a go for it. TV movies have simple stories, so don't they to surprise me all the time. To create a story around Christmas is not that easy, because there are hundred of films comes every year based on the same festival. How it all starts and ends are almost predictable, but topic on which it rides on is very important. This one was about the tree. The decorated tree in the city centre that delights all the Chicagoans. But its responsibility to make sure are things are taken care comes under a young woman named Holly aka Miss Christmas.

Just a week to go, Holly has reached the source destination for her new tree, but trouble awaits. That the family who own the tree is divided over donating it for some sentimental reason. Now she has to convince them, and how she does that with other personal events unfolds in the rest of the film. Being an animal and tree lover, I hated her approach. I never support such cruel act, just to please someone to enjoy the festival by killing a tree. Not just one, billions of people do it around the world which brings catastrophe in nature every year. Apart from that, the film was average. A family film, particularly for the female audience.

Just as I thought watching Christmas films are over, only the real Christmas is what left to enjoy, I came across with this film. This is a last moment review written in the week of Christmas eve. The reason I liked was, it is another Christmas film based on the book of the same name. I think Hallmark should adapt books more often. The original screenplays are almost nothing. No innovation, not interesting enough. But literature based films like this makes a lot sense to watch. With an artistic presentation, the depth in characters and events, the story is well convincing.

Well, the story is not new. We all know it, especially how it's going to turn out at the end. But that's not the issue. How much you are satisfied with the way it all were told matters. So apart from a good story, the actors and director too makes an impact. I think it all worked out well for this. Yet there was a small drawback that towards the end of the second act, the story dried up. I mean literally when all the important matter was sorted out, the rest of the narration till the final twist was simply a drag. A time killer with casual scenes.

> -xX] Look around you, and then close your eyes. Put everything you just saw into your brain like a picture. That way, you can keep it, even after we've gone. [Xx-

Willa, a single mother and her young boy is all set to enjoy their Christmas in the Bramble house BnB. On the other side of the tale, Finn disappointed with his father who had died weeks ago, left nothing to him, but for a stranger, Willa. So he decides to find out the reason and confront her with a legal option. Now, on the eve of the Christmas week, they meet at the Bramble house and develop an unexpected relationship with mother and son. Once the truth ready to get out, what happens and how the story would end was told quite nicely.

The character Finn looked good, but with a bad intention in his mind makes a villain, at least in the beginning. The actor who played it kind looked expressionless, even when he smiled. As the story went on, he looked better. Maybe I got used to it. Because slowly his behaviour has changed, leaving us to expect, how he would react at the end. You know without making something into a complicate, there's no end twist. In this, it was his identity and purpose of meeting Willa. That character makes this tale possible. But Willa is the one mysterious until she reveal about her life, particularly the secret about her son.

One of the good Christmas films of this season I've seen. More importantly, it emotionally get us. That's crucial if the film is aimed for families. Of course not without romance theme, otherwise these things won't work, but it was not focused on that thing alone. Mixing the festival occasion, romance, and personal life was neatly done. So if you want to watch a Christmas film, this won't be a bad pick. But as I always say, this is a television film, so be compromised on the overall perspective of the product and enjoy.

She goes all in with young teen angst in each of the story lines she's in as she's in every story line except for the weirdness with mom almost leaving dad.

Before long, there are tourists in town, cash registers ringing, and a nationally syndicated television show scouring the woods for a sasquatch.  It's a Christmas miracle - or is it?

My rating for Pottersville seems at odds with conventional wisdom.  It’s obvious that I enjoy this one much, much more than most people.  For many reason, the film worked for me.  The cast is brilliant - from Michael Shannon playing against character to the always enjoyable Judy Greer to the gruff but funny Ian McShane, I had a blast with the cast.  The plot is a another plus for me.  It's just quirky enough to keep me entertained throughout.  The bits about the furries, the bigfoot sightings, and the ""unique"" townspeople are all interesting touches.  I've read several complaints about the lack of real comedy and, while I can agree to a point, there are enough moments that made me at least smile that I didn't need to laugh out loud to find the comedy enjoyable.  Overall, I had a good time with Pottersville and have no problems rating it higher than most others.

My biggest complaint with Pottersville and the thing that keeps me from rating it higher is Tom Lennon.  A little Lennon goes a long way.  He's given way, way too much screentime.  I admit that some of his interactions with Ian McShane and the Nelson Mandela song dedicaiton were quite funny, but overall, he's annoying.  Less Lennon and I might have rated Pottersville even higher.,","christmas,",19,3,"Seth Henrikson,"

Her determination to succeed in spite of the odds became a passion even before she realized her true purpose in Gombe. 

I’m not one to have idols but if I did she would be one. So goddamn inspiring in so many ways.

This doc is essentially rediscovered found footage from 2014 that was shot during the 60s when Goodall first went to Africa to study the chimps and what that was like and how challenging it was. So from this “lost” footage the filmmakers had to construct a narrative, which becomes the story of Goodall’s life from childhood to present day, including her marriage to Hugo and raising her son around apes. Half of this film works extremely well. The other half is typical biography filler to round out her story. The average rating between these two parts is 8/10. I’d prefer to watch more of her time with the chimps, what was learned from this experience and how she was able to share that with the world.,","africa,tanzania,biography,chimpanzee,primatologist,jane goodall,female scientist,conservationist,",3,34,"Brett Morgen,"

This is a male version of 'A Gift Wrapped Christmas'. Like most of the Christmas films, this is also a romance-drama. A man who earned the nickname Mr. Christmas for his ability to pick the ideal Christmas gifts for people is now not set to find one for his friend's girlfriend. But when they are introduced to each other, the things changes around. They two seems started to have feelings. Then there's always a truth that's ready to strike to make the issue even complicated. How this love triangle tale ends were told in the remaining part.

The story was just okay. But the actors were good. Typical Hallmark Christmas film. Always guessable and a romance drama that takes place in the snow falling region/city. Mainly instantly falling in love kind of theme. Knowing the storyline, I knew it was not my cup of tea. Despite I did not enjoy it very much, it was not that bad. I did not feel boring, or annoyance. Using old contents and giving a decent film is not an easy task, but they have done a better job. Its for the home audience, the women would enjoy it. So I respect and give it an average. Neither loved nor disliked, like 50/50.

The best part of this film is it was not your typical Christmas film. When it says 'Switched', that seems not interesting. There are many films on that theme, so you might think you are exhausted to take a chance on this. But this is a good, a decent one at least. Even though, it revolved on a silly concept, everything was told in a much better way. I meant very maturely, without any fuss.

Chris and Kate a twin drifted away while growing into adults. Now on one Christmas eve they are brought together by their loving father. They envied each others lives, which led them to switch the place just for like a day as they did a long ago. But the following events made them stay a bit longer. For such deed, there's always waits a serious consequence to explode and how that affects these sisters are revealed in the climax.

Only recently I've checked out Candance Cameron's 'Aurora Teagarde Mystery' film series and liked them. So I was excited for this to see her one more time. A much better Christmas film I've seen in this season. Because usually Christmas themed films are overwhelmed with nothing but Christmas elements. This one happened in the backdrop of Christmas, but the preference was given to other than that. Forget about the cliches, but still it is worth a watch. Nothing like children's films you've seen on the same theme.

Like every year in December, my quest begins to watch some of the Christmas films. Mostly the television films, and that too obviously the Hallmark films. As I have mentioned previous years, it's impossible to avoid such seasonal film, if you are a cinephile. I almost saw a dozen of films, they all were decent, but none of them quite impressed me, until this one. This is not like the best film of the season, but among those I've seen, it is that I really enjoyed.

Based on the novel of the same name. I don't know if the book was a Christmas themed, but this one was tuned to the festival occasion. From the television director who had done a film series recently. The actors I don't know, but I liked their good performances. One big drawback in all the Hallmark Christmas films is they are predictable. The films usually aimed for middle-aged to older women in the family. That's not me and I'm aware of that, so I compromise while rating and reviewing, that I always end up saying 50/50. This one rarely stood just above that mark, so here I'm with my feature review.

Darcy is a young woman who works in a prominent bookstore in the town. Very active and always just in time for everything. But on one occasion, she has been late for work, so while hurrying on the road with her bike, collides with a stranger. Now he's in the hospital with amnesia. Feeling guilty, Darcy decides to help him out to gain his memory. So her adventure to find his real identity, and while following events pushes them so close. But if he regains his memory, it might put her in a disappointing state. Because that's what truth always does.

This could be my last Christmas film of this year. And I'm quite happy I enjoyed it and the season ended on a high. The concept of amnesia worked so well for this film. Because of that, the suspense grew and held back until the finale. Obviously that end part was predictable, due to this is a family film and all the family films ends positive note. If you know that and set your mind accordingly, then you would also have a good time with it.

Well, the dog had a nice role. I anticipated more part for him, but a limited one. Usually all the Christmas films made for the television are cliched romance tale, especially the initiation. This was unique, well, better than the most. That best start carried out decently in the middle section. Nothing much fuss. With a bunch of wonderful characters and lines and shot in the nicest locations, the film had the upper hand throughout.

I hope it is as good as the original source. One of the reasons I liked it was not being entirely about Christmas. It sets in only on that backdrop. While the majority of the tale focused on romance. The memory loss brings the some fairy-tale perspective. Overall, it ended nicely. So this is the one I pick for this year and suggest a must see. That's only if you are seeking a Christmas film and also must be watched before the season ends for a better result. Finally, I must say this that I enjoyed it does not mean you too would do the same. Hundreds of Christmas films come out every year, so choose wisely. You might find a better than this that I haven't seen!

- Antonio Piazza; ""How _Sicilian Ghost Story_'s directors are transforming Italian cinema"" (Jack Rear); _Verdict_ (August 1, 2018)

_Sicilian Ghost Story_ is cinema as art, in the purest sense of the term. Extraordinary aesthetic beauty and not a small amount of technical virtuosity contain a narrative that is emotionally devastating, but also paradoxically uplifting. It's hard to believe this is only co-writers/co-directors Antonio Piazza and Fabio Grassadonia's second film.

As the lights came up at the screening I attended, I sat in a kind of stupefied silence, staring at the credits rolling on the screen, too flummoxed to really move. This is something that has only happened to me a handful of times, when the (call it what you wish) artistic potency, aesthetic splendour, emotional catharsis has overwhelmed me, and I've turned into a gibbering idiot. To cite some recent(ish) examples: Michael Mann's _Heat_ (1995), Terrence Malick's _The Thin Red Line_ (1998), Darren Aronofsky's _Requiem for a Dream_ (2000), Stephen Daldry's _The Hours_ (2002), Malick's _The Tree of Life_ (2011), Michaël R. Roskam's _Rundskop_ (2011), and Benh Zeitlin's _Beasts of the Southern Wild_. _Sicilian Ghost Story_ now joins that venerable list.

On an unconscious level, I was trying to process the wave of emotions sweeping over me, trying to qualify and characterise what I was feeling, and by so during, drag it from the unconscious into consciousness. There, I'd have a better chance of understanding why the film had had such a profound effect on me, why it had burrowed under my skin so completely. Then, suddenly, I realised I was employing completely the wrong interpretative strategy; I was trying to analyse the film on an ontological level which, for the most part, it doesn't exist. I was looking at it from an intellectual point of view, when the film operates almost wholly on an emotional plane. And with that realisation came another; to fully engage with the film critically, one must allow oneself to become emotionally involved rather than remain intellectually detached (a reverse _Verfremdungseffekt_, if you will). And there's a very specific content-driven reason why the film operates on the emotional rather than the intellectual level, which we'll look at in a moment, and which speaks to just how accomplished a piece of work this is.

Beginning in 1993, _Sicilian Ghost Story_ tells the story of Luna (an extraordinary debut performance by Julia Jedlikowska, who carries the entire film) and Giuseppe (Gaetano Fernandez), two thirteen-year-olds living in Palermo, on the Italian island of Sicily. Both come from difficult domestic situations, and are slowly awakening to the fact that they seem to be falling in love. Giuseppe is the son of a Cosa Nostra hitman who has recently turned state's witness in prison, whilst every aspect of Luna's home life is controlled by her domineering mother (Sabine Timoteo), although she has a good relationship with her diminutive father (Vincenzo Amato). Luna is also very close with classmate Loredana (Corinne Musallari), who lives nearby, and with whom she communicates at night via Morse code. Everything is relatively normal in their lives until Giuseppe disappears. Deeply upset, Luna is incredulous at the community's lack of reaction – nobody seems to either care or want to do anything to try to find Giuseppe, indeed most people won't even acknowledge anything has happened at all. With this in mind, Luna determines to find him herself, quickly realising that the two share a kind of psychic connection, upon which she must rely if she is ever to see him again.

The film is adapted from Marco Mancassola's short-story ""Un cavaliere bianco"" [""A White Knight""] in his 2011 book, _Non saremo confusi per sempre_ [_We Won't Be Confused Forever_]. The book gives a fantasy-based fictional account of, and links together, five real-life Italian cases – Vittorio Emanuele's murder of Dirk Hamer in 1978 (""Un principe azzurro""); Alfredo Rampi's death after falling down a well in 1981 (""Un bambino al centro della terra""); Eluana Englaro's seventeen-year coma after a car crash, from 1992 to 2009 (""Una bella addormentata""); the kidnapping, torture, and murder of eleven-year-old Giuseppe Di Matteo in 1996 (""Un cavaliere bianco""); and, Federico Aldrovandi's death in 2005 after being beaten by four policemen (""Un ragazzo fantasma"").

Giuseppe Di Matteo was the son of Santino Di Matteo (known as Mezzanasca), a hitman for the Cosa Nostra. In 1992, Mezzanasca took part in the murder of Giovanni Falcone, a judge working to break the power of the Mafia in Sicily. The following year, he was arrested, and soon turned _pentito_, i.e. he became an informer. In retaliation, the Mafia kidnapped his eleven-year-old son, Giuseppe. The plan was to use Giuseppe to silence Mezzanasca, torturing him, and sending pictures to his father demanding that he recant his testimony. However, Mezzanasca refused to cooperate, and continued to work with the police. After 779 days of imprisonment, Giuseppe was strangled to death on the orders of Mezzanasca's former colleague, Giovanni Brusca, and his body subsequently dissolved in a vat of acid so as to prevent it being discovered and examined for evidence, also forcing the family to stage a funeral without a body, a practice known as _lupara bianca_. As in the film, Mancassola uses the real-life events as the starting-point for an otherworldly, fantastical narrative which follows Luna's increasingly non-corporeal attempts to find Giuseppe.

When the film opened Semaine de la Critique at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival (the first Italian film to do so), it received a ten-minute standing ovation, and has already won a slew of awards – the 2016 Sundance Institute/Mahindra Global Film Award; Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2017 David di Donatello Awards (also nominated for Best Song, Best Cinematography, and the David Giovani Award); Best Cinematography and Best Set Design at the 2017 Nastri d'argento (also nominated for Best Film and Best Directors); Best Screenplay at the 2017 Athens International Film Festival; Best Film and Best Actress at the 2017 Magna Grecia Awards; Best Cinematography at the 2017 Valletta Film Festival; the ARCA CinemaGiovani Award at the 2017 Fiuggi Film Festival; the Ischia Movie Award at the 2017 Ischia Global Film & Music Fest; Prix Special du public at the 2017 CinéAlma Festival; the Audience Award at the 2018 Saas-Fee Filmfest; and Best Cinematography at the 2018 Ciak d'oro.

In short, the film is creating a lot of waves.

The murder of Giuseppe was the culmination of a wave of Mafia violence in Sicily throughout the 80s and into the 90s. Pizza and Grassadonia were themselves so disturbed by the case that they left Sicily altogether. Many years later, they became interested in telling Giuseppe's story. However, as the real-life events offered no catharsis or redemption, no justice, and ended with a child being dissolved in acid, they were unsure how best to approach the material. It was only after they read ""Un cavaliere bianco"" that they decided to turn the case into a dark fable, and focus not on Giuseppe (the ghost of the title), but on the fictional Luna.

With this in mind, _Sicilian Ghost Story_ is a fantasy-based love story first, and a fact-based tale of violence and murder second. Indeed, it could just as legitimately be called _Sicilian Love Story_. Poetic and magical in equal measure, although it spends a great deal of time within Luna's imagination/unconscious, it remains grounded in the Cosa Nostra-dominated Sicilian culture of the early 90s (imagine Neil Jordan's _The Company of Wolves_ (1984) directed by Martin Scorsese). Because of this duality, although the film tells an undeniably dark story, Pizza and Grassadonia were able to craft a paradoxically uplifting _dénouement_.

The duality also works on the level at which the audience receives the film - the focus on Luna's unconscious, on her dreams, on her psychic link with Giuseppe, provides a buffer for the audience, softening the impact of the real-life Giuseppe's horrific death whilst still respecting the events, albeit from within the frame of a fantasy-based narrative. Speaking to Charles Tesson during Semaine de la Critique at Cannes, Piazza and Grassadonia state,

> _the only way to [tell the story] was for us to create a collision between a level of reality and a level of fantasy. On the level of reality, a dark fable. On the level of fantasy, a romantic fable._

This may seem distasteful to some, as the film posits that love is able to transcend violence, and, ultimately, give freedom to the soul, but the directors state,

> _at the end, another reality is revealed, one which surpasses dreams and nightmares, a reality in which ghosts reveal their true nature, their very solid and indestructible reality as souls._

Obviously, this aspect of the story has no correlation with the horrific real-life events. However, Pizza and Grassadonia argue that they are essentially resurrecting the real Giuseppe, insofar as the story is not especially well known, even in Sicily itself – for example, all of the young cast are from Sicily, but none of them knew anything about Giuseppe. Speaking to verdict.co.uk, they argue that the film's narrative allows them to approach the facts of the case in a unique way; as Luna is

> _using a fantasy, her imagination, and dreams at night, to reimagine reality. A revolution against the facts, the way they are told. Sometimes facts become written in stone and become something that you have to destroy. Fantasy, for us, is a political act._

In terms of the content, as I have already mentioned, the film exists on an emotional level rather than an intellectual one, and the audience will get the most from it if they allow themselves to engage with it on that same emotional level. Piazza and Grassadonia liken this to _Romeo and Juliet_, a dark, violent story in which children die horrible deaths, but which works because Shakespeare's verse allows readers an emotional distance from the events of the (not especially well-structured) plot; if one analyses the play on a purely intellectual level, it makes little sense. However, on an emotional level, it works perfectly. _Sicilian Ghost Story_ operates in a similar way – the emotional is far more important than the intellectual. This is all tied into how Piazza and Grassadonia wanted to honour the real Giuseppe, but rather than presenting a fact-based intellectual film, they instead made an emotion-based fairy-tale. That the film operates on this emotional level is tied into its very DNA.

As to my experience, I became aware I was watching something extraordinary in the opening scene. Inside a cave, the camera travels over dark rocks. A weak light emanates from the mouth of the cave, and reflects off the droplets of water on the rocks. As the camera moves, and the screen fills with a black background permeated by soft white spots, one could be looking at an expansive star field rather than being confined inside a cave, a shot which recalls the scene on the driving range in Michael Mann's _The Insider_ (1999), which has a similarly disorientating effect (although used by the director for a very different end).

As the film continued, it became increasingly obvious to me that the form and content are so intrinsically bound together, that it's difficult to tell which is generating which. For example, the music (which is non-diegetic, and therefore form) bleeds into the foley (which is diegetic, and therefore content). But does the foley give rise to the music or does the music give rise to the foley?

The filmmakers also employ a litany of techniques to link, contrast, and compare various scenes. Animal imagery appears throughout; an owl in the opening shot is seen multiple times over the course of the rest of the film, and also highlighted are butterflies, a stout, a dog, spiders, and, especially, horses. There's even a reference to Pan (although, thankfully, no mention of having sex with goats or pederasty). On a more technical level, Pizza and Grassadonia's visual trickery is exceptionally accomplished, and they employ it perfectly, always justified by the content; fisheye lenses, Dutch angles, asymmetrical framing, chiaroscuro lighting, soft focus, forced perspective, etc.

As I was musing on what I would talk about in this review, I realised that most of the reasons I loved the film so much will be the exact same reasons that a lot of people hate it – the narrative ambiguity, the only-ever-hinted-at possibility of something ethereal living in the forest, the slightly confusing achronological structure, the camera trickery, the slow pacing, the bleak morality, the non-diegetic light sources, the naturalistic acting, the symbolism and visual metaphors, the use of a real-life murder as the subject for an oneiric romance dealing with first love, the (at times) oppressive music, the tacit disregard for genre, the two scenes where the narrative progression simply stops completely and there are two four-or-five-minute sequences that don't advance the plot in any way, but which are achingly beautiful, and central to the film's overriding theme – that love can transcend all.

If I was being forced to criticise, I suppose, the way the narrative folds back on itself without really alerting the audience that it's a flashback can be a little disorientating, but this is hardly a criticism, as disorientation is obviously the point, as the film attempts to place the audience in the same confused headspace as Giuseppe. It also starts a little slow and doesn't instantly pull you in. But that's it. I wouldn't say a single negative word about anything else.

This is cinema as art. Point of fact, it's nothing less than a masterpiece.,","sicily, italy,village,disappearance,",15,35,"Antonio Piazza,"

The final cut must've changed the story because what was promised appeared to only be on screen for a few minutes.

And when the trailer's story finally starts, it abruptly ends - but doesn't end the movie, which somehow keeps going and really ends, but abruptly once again.

The writers or director seemingly had trouble deciding when and how to end the film. It feels like there was an idea that developed, changed and somehow didn't fit with the beginning.

Karthi does an impressive job as the glorified hero Theeran and most of the film is carried by his character. Although at times the heroism is a bit too stretched that one may think that it would have been better if the sole focus of the narrative wasn't through the single character.

""Theeran Adhigaram Ondru"" is a solid crime thriller which compromises a little for commercialization yet manages to be an impressive account of a brutal true story. As the title refers the film as Adhigaaram Ondru meaning Chapter One, there are chances of a sequel. But the Operation Bawariya story is finished here and since the character is fictional they can go on with a fictional story. Although, let us hope that it won't turn out like the atrocious ""Singam"" trilogy starring Surya, elder brother of Karthi.

The 1985 Heysel disaster where 39 Juventus fans lost their lives before the European Cup Final with Liverpool. Then in 1989 the Hillsborough disaster that led to the death of 96 Liverpool fans.

Kenny Dalglish went to the funeral of each and every victim of Hillsborough. It took a toll in his health and in 1991 he walked out of the Liverpool manager's job.

Dalglish was always reluctant when talking to the press. Here he reveals a little more about himself and his impish humour.,","sports,football (soccer),",19,7,"Stewart Sugg,"

And while this docu-miniseries does have some good things going for it, with new interviews some from people who've not been very outspoken previously on the matter.

But in the last episode the show feels like it was made as a cash-grab and that Lolita Files (who is one of the hosts and producers) was in it only to plug her newly released book about Jim Brennan who was one of the investigators of Tupac's murder. And of course they come to the conclusion that the only realistic scenario is that of which her book includes (the Orlando Brown Crip payback theory).

Now that's actually the theory I believe myself, but I felt like they didn't give any of the other scenarios any real chance.

Sure the Puffy ordered hit on Pac theory is a bit of a stretch BUT they paint it out as Puffy being a proffesional not dabbling in criminal activities to debunk the theory (when in fact Puffy's had a number of violent acts in his crime sheet, alot of which were acts against people in the music-business) I'm not saying that I believe the theory but don't just debunk stuff by hiding facts.

The Death Row Takeover is the most interesting conspiracy theory IMO, as it is a rather plausible one. And for the whole episode it seems that the conclusion is gonna be that this MIGHT be it, especially when Reggie Wright Jr sounds and looks more guilty everytime he's in front of the camera. And the suspicious O.A. (Orlando Anderson?) payment shortly after Tupac's death from David Kenner's account. But at the end of that episode they yet again somehow manages to rule that theory out, with no reason whatsoever of doing so it just isn't the theory that they are trying to sell you (and make you read more about in Lolita Files book).

And they didn't even try to get into the Lil Half Dead theory they pretty much debunked that before they got into it, and they didn't even bother to ask Half Dead any tough questions, not even why Half Dead on his Dead Serious album have included a dead Tupac on the cover. And I found it odd that he said that him and Snoop met Tupac and everything was friendly the day before when Snoop has always said that Tupac and him were on bad terms on the time of his death (due to Snoop being friends with both BIG and Pac).

Anyways it's a whole lot of stuff they should have done different and taken their task more seriously. But the interviews are still mostly pretty interesting (as a person who's interested at least). But episode 6 was awful and they showed their true colors there I felt.

Also Benjamin Crump seemed to be on there just to promote BlackLivesMatter and moments where he was shocked seemed like straight up (poor) acting. And it wouldn't surprise me if that police investigation paper regarding the murder weapon was manufactured by the producers themselves for dramatic effect.

But yeah it's still mostly enjoyable, just take everything with a grain of salt and use your own head to think instead of going by the conclusions of these hosts.,",,19,0,"Kazuhiro Furuhashi,"

He was a charming, clever Etonian, with powerful friends everywhere. And lovers too - at a time when homosexuality was illegal, Burgess made no secret of his sexual tastes. He turned out to be the most flamboyant of a ring of privileged Cambridge students who had secretly joined the Communists in the 1930s, disgusted by their own government's policy of appeasing Hitler.

During the English Civil War two soldiers from opposite sides of the conflict find themselves alone in the woods against each other. As one is older and thus more experienced things are not equal between them, but the elder soldier underestimates the younger soldier's survival instinct in what leads to a cat and mouse game during which they discover they are not as alone as they thought and find themselves unable to leave the woods, trapped by a witch.

The cinematography in Hex is simply beautiful taking full advantage of lush woodland scenery and an old ruins. Re-enactment props and costumes give it an authentic look, combined with the scenery, beyond its means. The audio in this is truly amazing, from the slightest brush of tall grass to a crackle in a fire to a babble in a brook, the environment is full and crisp.

Three incredibly talented actors bring to life a story tautly stretched in tension. The director keeps the mystery going making good use of the surroundings, the night, and of course the unknown. Fear and suspicion rule day and night for the soldiers, not only of an unseen enemy but of an unknown trust as to whether they could turn on each other at any moment. The tension plays out as thick as the tall grass in the meadows.

This is not a story of just a moment in history, as that is its adornment, but within is an allegory pertinent in our times that certainly provides something to think about and stays with you, for those who don't shrink away from it. Slow paced it is, and it could have used some trimming in my opinion, but beautiful and haunting throughout is what sight, sound and an open mind will reveal.,",,4,2,"Jonathan Russell,"

Smart was abducted as a young teen, held captive by a deranged couple, brainwashed, and repeatedly raped for almost a year before she was able to escape.  The film also explores the pain and suffering experienced by her family as they faced the initial shock and terror of a missing child, their ordeal with the police, and the highs and lows they experienced trying to find Elizabeth.

I’m not sure “entertaining” is the right word to use, but Elizabeth Smart: Autobiography is certainly a compelling piece of television.  Elizabeth Smart’s story is one of courage, bravery, and an unending faith.  It’s the story of a girl who did whatever she had to deal with her situation and survive.  Elizabeth Smart iis amazingly calm as she recounts her ordeal.  The specifics she details are heartbreaking.  I’m amazed at Smart’s poise as the horrors she faced unfold.  What an amazing woman.

The only reason I haven’t rated this a 10/10 was that I wanted more from Smart and less from the family.  While their ordeal was no doubt gut-wrenching, their story isn’t as “interesting” as Elizabeth’s.  Less family and more Elizabeth Smart would have made this thing even better.  Still, it’s a minor quibble with what is overall a wonderful documentary.

After watching this, I was interested to learn more about Elizabeth Smart’s story.  I’m shocked to read numerous posts on the internet that doubt her and the truth behind her ordeal.  Most question why she didn’t try to escape and why it took her so long to admit she was Elizabeth Smart when questioned by the police.  I think she does an excellent job of addressing this in the film.  If you’ve never been in her situation, don’t judge.  You have no idea what she was going through.  Her fear was real and her reluctance to do or say something is completely understandable.  These doubters infuriate me.,",,1,2,"Steve Michaels,"

""Mirada de Cristal"" perfectly captures the essence of Italian horror productions from the late 70s and 80s and this is something that I personally loved to see. It features all the elements that made those movies from that particular era so fun to watch: an uncomplicated plot with the right amount of mystery, fun characters, creative death scenes, a killer wearing a very distinctive mask, a bright color palette and great music.

While watching ""Mirada de Cristal"", I couldn't help but thinking of one of my favorite Italian horror flicks from the 80s, like Michele Soavi's ""Deliria"" (aka ""Stage Fright""), especially with all those colorful lights, the flamboyant characters with diva attitudes and the creative death scenes. The characters are one of the many things I love about this flick: they are clearly supposed to be over the top and somewhat campy, so I also give credit to the actors for delivering their lines in a way that was very evocative of those flicks from the 80s. I especially enjoyed seeing the late Silvia Montanari and veteran actress Claudia Lapacó in a small role towards the very end. To be fair, though, most of the cast members were up to the task, not only the most famous ones.

Though the budget was modest (and it shows from time to time), directors Ezequiel Endelman and Leandro Montejano used it wisely enough for the most part. They tried to recreate the aesthetics of the dance academy from ""Suspiria"" (1977), which is not exactly easy to do with moderate budget, but somehow, they managed to get the job done (hell, we even get a brief glimpse of ornamental glass peacock!). I regret to say that, at times, the scenery looked perhaps a little bit too stiff and cartoonish. I don't know if this was intentional or not, but I personally didn't care for it that much. That being said, I'll take artificial scenery over lousy CGI any day! For the most part, the scenery was great. The photography and the strident color scheme was very well done and it reminded me of Dario Argento's ""Inferno"" (1980), for the most part.

Throughout the entire film, the killer wears a patent leather trench coat, high heels and a creepy mask of a woman with heavy makeup and dead eyes. When chasing his/her victims, the killer walks as if he/she were on a catwalk, even going so far as to strike glamorous poses (how can anyone not enjoy the deliberate campiness of this?). The chase scenes are very well done, providing just the right amount of tension and without being unnecessarily prolonged. As for the kills, they are really creative and intentionally over the top (the one with the crystal bird was just perfect). As for the killer's identity reveal, well, it really wasn't very surprising, but, who cares? Most ""old-school"" slashers were predictable to a certain extent too, so I don't consider this a flaw.

I really enjoyed this movie and I think those who have watched more than a couple of Italian/American horror productions from the 80s will be able to acknowledge that both directors really have a tremendous passion for horror flicks and they put a lot of effort into this. They evidently cared about their film, nothing felt rushed, they took a lot of time and dedication to take care of even the tiniest details and it shows. When something is done with such devotion, it most likely ends up getting the recognition it deserves.,",,27,2,"Leandro Montejano,"

Mufti did exactly the same, it not only created the hype but also held the pulses of the people patiently all through the year and those became impulsive the moment the trailer was released and then those were again held back until the film was officially released( ie today). Now the film, in reply, is getting pulsating response as a payback by the audience.
Mufti, right from its film’s title to star-cast and their appearances, created raging curiosity among the audiences but barring few niggles it completely lives up to the expectations.

This underworld-crime thriller starts with a spy-operation by Police Department in collecting the evidences against Bhairathi Ranagal ( The underworld Don Character played by Shivanna ) to bring him to the books but fails miserably resulting in loss of lives. Gana ( the undercover cop character played by Srimurali) is planted as one of the gangsters in Bhairathi Ranagal gang and what unfolds on the screen further is an engaging crime thriller along with predicable drama (with a mixed sequences of politics-comedy-romantic ). Gana slowly understands the pain-points of Bhairathi Ranagal which made him to take up the crime who acts malevolently against the odd ones and remain equally benevolent to the needy ones. Gana who joins the gang to arrest Bhairathi Ranagal ends up becoming an admirer of his benevolence but this underworld-crime thriller, as expected, ends within the confines of the law.

The director has cleverly drawn the parallels between the characters ie Srimurali Vs Vashisht Simha, Srimurali Vs Shivanna, Shivanna Vs Devaraj and then there is an emotional parallel between Shivanna and his sister which is expressed through emotional-act with no-word-uttered between the both until the climax. All the roles played by each character stands aplomb.

Every star in this film has his own mass-appeal and screen presence which is perfectly used by the Director and nowhere the movie goes beyond the line to overly-commercialize the enterprise( except comedy-romantic tracks).

Shivanna has played many Don roles in the past but this will stand aloof in his list. His acting and more importantly the dialogue delivery looks stylish and something stands as a renewed energy on a whole. Srimurali’s intensity, his high octane action sequences and perfect one-liners takes the lion-pie of Mufti and he perfectly plays as a foil for Shivanna. Then comes Vashisht Simha who plays wily-gangster role and perfectly grabs whatever the screen time is allotted wish his screen time was stretched a bit more. Devaraj, the seasoned actor easily glides into politician role. Prakash Belwadi is apt in small role.

The entry scenes of Srimurali and Shivanna, train sequence, action sequence at temple, accident trap by Devaraj for Srimurali with flashback dialogue, pre-climax fight, climax and couple of emotional scenes stands tall along with crisp dialogues. If cinematography by Naveen Kumar is cynosure to eyes then music and background music by Ravi Basrur is the soul of the film.

In spite having just two songs in the film and slightly predictable narration the film never dips or bores but what completely distracts or disowns the same narration are the unwanted comedy tracks of Chikkanna-Sadhu Kokila as well as romantic-track between Shanvi Shrivastav and Srimurali. If the Director wants to make this film look classical then he should sit tonight and completely edit these two tracks and send apology letters to the concerned actors involved in these two tracks for editing out their scenes.

Narthan(who earlier assisted to Prashant Neel for his Ugramm), the Director has choosen the underworld crime thriller to make his perfect launch in a big way. His toil is completely shown on the screen.

Conceived as a mock TV series set in a Brutalist housing estate, her exhibition at Glasgow’s Tramway comprises three separate videos (or “episodes”). Made between 2017 and 2018 and collectively titled “Amos’ World,” each is screened concurrently in accompanying installations with soundtracks played on headphones. Dotted around the space are props and sets used on screen: scale-model shelves of colored binders, a miniature forest. As “Amos’ World” suggests, the egoistic visionaries Amos parodies were not ultimately in control of their designs.

What stays awake is the daily repression of sensuality in the name of a constructed morality naturalised by the weight of history.

The haunting and otherwordly film set to an original score features small every day acts of refusal, resistance, and existence—such as performance and self expression—that have a tremendous impact on the world. The film reveals how the historical and systemic violence, like the killing and policing of black queer and trans life, continue to haunt our contemporary landscapes and is inextricably linked to the ongoing AIDS epidemic and the black queer/trans spaces shaped so intimately by HIV/AIDS, including the spaces where we come together and make life together: public spaces and nightlife spaces.",0.6,/yASRIqUBAmrSfU7QH8ogPOBa6PU.jpg,2017-12-03,0,8.0,Released,,Atlantic is a Sea of Bones,False,0.0,0,,,,,"US,",0,,,0,1,"Tourmaline,"

The story is of an estranged father and daughter, separated by a divorce. The father has fallen apart and really needs someone to pull him out of the dark.

Throughout the film, color is used very selectively. Almost everything is drab, dull tones, except for the stunning red which surrounds Nina, the daughter.

After Christmas Dinner, Nina and Patrick, the father, go have a talk. She tells her father of a memory, one he claims not to remember, before she disappears.

The story hadn't been exactly happy, and shortly after, a woman in a mask begins to follow Patrick around. He attempts to drink away the memory, but that only induces a nightmare.

The nightmare turns dangerous, and the next day, the site manager finds Patrick strangled by seaweed.

This film is fantastic as a short. We don't know how or why Nina died, but we do know that she did not have a happy life with Patrick. It's implied that he drank to the point of forgetfulness and had more than your average temper. We know that Nina was seeking revenge.

In the end, the details of Nina's life after Patrick and even her death don't matter. Heck, her life before her parents split probably doesn't matter to the story much.

Without the uncessceary fluff, the filmmaker can spend more screen time on breathtaking cinematic shots, showing a world devoid of color, except for the color that surrounds Nina's coming and going. Every interaction between Nina and Patrick is also incredibly important to figuring out anything about either of them, especially with how few lines of dialogue fill the film.,",,4,7,"Sean Hogan,"

In a sweet impressionist film, Samara returns to the city she fled as a teenager to immerse herself in memories that are still buried there, in various places and in dusty boxes containing diaries, photos and VHS tapes. 1999 is not a ghost story, although it is populated by ghosts. The snow-covered streets, corridors and locker rooms of the school are intact, as in a dream, but the absence left by the wave of teenage suicides still resonates with unanswered questions, trauma and regret. Samara meets inspiring people who carry with them great pain and who, 16 years later, can finally comfort each other by breaking a long silence. In the end, the film interweaves different voices and gives rise to a collective reflection on the internalization of mourning and the need to learn to affirm one's desire to survive.",0.6,/oDUO7Vn37jyv0diTYRuTFA8OqT3.jpg,2017-11-20,0,90.0,Released,,1999,False,0.0,0,"Documentary,","Parábola Filmes,ONF | NFB,",,"en,fr,","SE,CA,",0,,"suicide,high school,teen suicide,woman director,",0,2,"Samara Grace Chadwick,"
