Pictures,Dune Entertainment,Farah Films & Management,Reliance Entertainment,Village Roadshow Pictures,",,"en,","US,",7,"There's a moment in this movie when the central character says ""I love her"". His friend hastily replies, ""Slow down bro... she could be a 300 lb man living in his mom's basement."" In the very brief beat between the two lines, I thought FINALLY a movie about falling in love completely independent of what a person's genetics may be. And then the crushing cynicism in a dystopian world where there is little to live for and even less to hope for: even in a nightmare, a fat man is undateable.

Don't worry though. If you have the skills you may end up on top. Just like Ben Mendelsohn's slave-owning antagonist almost did. Because in this story, it's not a world where anyone feels compassion or empathy. It's a world where everyone only thinks of themselves. A sociopath's dream. And that's what earns the top prize.

I love looking at Tye Sheridan. But not enough to sit through this again.,I watched this movie because I was once working in the VR industry and really curious what it could tell us (even though I am not really interested after watching the trailer).

Anyway, the experience is not bad (in 4DX). But not recommended for a second watch since there is little to dig and feel except for the numerous, eye-dazzling amount of Easter eggs.

Sorry.,Another great movie from Steven Spielberg,Obviously everything from the book cannot go into the movie, however a lot of what got into the movie was not from the book. Too much focus on car chases and too little on solving a puzzle.

If you haven't read the book, read the book! it's much more awesome!,Can you imagine watching this if you didn't give a fuck about the '80s? Like there's nothing that happens in _Ready Player One_ that isn't a reference to **something** at least, but almost all of them are '80s references. I mean I worship at the altar of 1980s' references on a daily basis, and even for me this was only so-so, I fear to imagine what _Ready Player One_ might be like for someone who actually demands originality.

Honestly, it was better than I was expecting, I'll front to that. The promotional campaign for this had the barometer for my excitement on this at a firm zero, and by the time I had finished watching it I was surprised to find I had actually enjoyed multiple things about it, but _Ready Player One_ is an exercise in lack of subtlety, and really tries your limits on suspension of disbelief. Not because of the fantastical endless virtual world inhabited by near every creation since the dawn of pop-culture, but because of the character interactions in their ""real world"".

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._,I did not know what I would really think about it when I started to watch this movie. I hoped that I would like it but I was not sure what I would actually get. I used to like Steven Spielberg a lot but later in his career he’s done movies that either was not my kind of movies or that I was simply not that impressed by. However, as it turned out, this one I liked a lot as you can see from my rating.

As a computer nerd and science fiction geek this movie was of course right up my alley. I have thought other movies would be my kind of movies before but been sorely disappointed by ignorant and incompetent screen writers and directors trying to cash in on subjects that they knew absolutely nothing about. Spielberg did a good job of not screwing this one up.

The core of this movie is of course plenty of action and computer generated special effects with a somewhat apocalyptic story to bind everything together. The story works but it is not really anything special and some of the stuff, like the loyalty centers, was frankly a bit silly. But, as I wrote, it works and does not get in the way so that’s good enough for me.

As the previously mentioned nerd and geek I absolutely loved the abundant references to science fiction, fantasy and gaming history and lore. For me those were soo cool. I will probably watch the movie again just to focus on the background and see how much stuff I can spot. Stuff that I missed when watching the movie the first time.

The CGI effects and the action was also pretty awesome. The movie starts off right away with a great and absolutely insanely wild car race and continues to go strong from there. The battle at Doom castle at the end is just epic.

The only thing that made me go WTF was at the end [SPOILER AHEAD] were Mr Asswipe Sorrento finally catches up with the High Five’s van and the he just freezes and looks at Wade with a silly look on his face. What the fuck was that? Just stupid for no good reason.

Well, few are the movies where there’s nothing to gripe about. On the whole though this movie was great in my book. Also, I cannot say how pleased I am to finally watch a Hollywood movie that is not a remake or a sequel or a prequel or some other lame excuse to rehash a movie that has already been made.,""Wild trip down memory lane... in a DeLorean""

In 2045 people escape their harsh reality by going to a virtual world called the OASIS. After the creator dies, he challenges all users to go on a hunt for an Easter egg which gives them control over the OASIS.

'Ready Player One' isn’t a movie you’d expect from a 71 year old filmmaker but Spielberg once again shows his range. It's an incredibly fun ride that’ll have you cracking up more than once (“It’s f***ing Chucky!”).

While Spielberg switches seamlessly between real life and the virtual reality it’s rather difficult to get emotionally invested in the movie. Nonetheless most characters are fun and the love story between Parzival/Wade and Art3mis/Samantha gives it some depth.
Ben Mendelsohn is delightful as the villain and Mark Rylance is excellent once again.

The biggest treat of course is the nostalgia. You’ll have a blast simply by counting the pop culture references(Iron Giant’s thumbs up and the Shining among my personal favorites). The movie features a killer 80’s soundtrack and Alan Silvestri provides the finishing touch with a wonderful score.

Ready Player One is a visual feast. See it on the biggest screen you can find. Preferably in Imax. Especially during the race you’ll be blown away.,","video game,based on novel or book,future,virtual reality,dystopia,nostalgia,love,evil corporation,quest,1980s,2040s,based on young adult novel,columbus, ohio,",81,387,"Steven Spielberg,"

Plus, the always scrumptious Scott Eastwood always welcome. Yowza!,This movie is, to me, a quite nice special effects extravaganza. In some ways I actually liked this movie more than the first one.

Sure, the underlying story is totally ludicrous. Come one, fighting giant monster with big clumsy robots that requires two people in some strange mind melt to maneuver is just ridiculous. Just send in a couple of fighter jets with some suitable devices that go boom and be done with it. But then, the purpose of these movies are to show off giant robot special effects and on that note they certainly deliver.

This installment in the franchise seems to be more geared towards the younger audience as far as the story and the cast goes. Some people like it, some don’t. Personally I’m fairly neutral.

As with the previous movie the story is not really that much to write home about. It has plot holes big enough to drive I giant robot through. I just had to say that didn’t I? Still, there are some parts of this story that I liked better than the first one. It is a quite straightforward story with clear heroes, clear bad guys.

It does not really have any of that lazy stupid plot twist where some dumb ass politicians are trying to shut down the program to save money. Sure the program is in some danger but this time it is due to a new program that actually sounds reasonable and could improve things. Of course said program gets sabotaged but hey, we, the audience, want our big silly robots right?

The story is also mostly devoid of any stupid SJW crap or silly green preaching. The ridiculous crap about Dinosaurs being the first invasion and that we had terraformed the planet (global warming and all that stuff) so a second invasion was more likely to succeed was just an insult to the more intelligent among the audience and took off a star or two from the first movie for me.

On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. It delivered where it counts, that is in the special effects department. Loads and loads of special effects mostly involving giant robots and Kaijus slugging it out with massive property damage as a result. They are literally beating each other up with skyscrapers for Christ sake!

The story, acting and everything else is adequate. Nothing more and nothing less. I do miss some colorful characters like Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) from the first movie. The characters in this one was more bland that has to be said.

It seems like a lot of people on IMDb and elsewhere have their pants in a twist over this movie and rates it one or two stars out of ten. That’s just nonsense. A one star rating is for a movie that is truly awful in all aspects. The special effects alone elevates this movie above one star. You might not like the turn towards the younger audience or something else in the movie but it still does not make it a one star movie.

Sure if you are not a science fiction or fantasy fan and do not care about special effects then I guess you could feel this is an awful movie but then why did you watch it in the first place? It is the second installment in the franchise so it should come as no surprise that the movie lives and dies by it’s special effects.

I would say that if you like giant robots, monsters and special effects and don’t mind a fairly thin story aimed for the slightly younger audience then there is a fair change that you will find this movie entertaining.,Boyega makes for a slightly more engaging lead than Charlie Hunnam did in the original, (co-pilot Eastwood is merely **as** dull as Charlie Hunnam) but _Uprising_ has virtually the exact same ups and down as the first _Pacific Rim_. If you dig that movie, you'll probably dig this. If you hated it, you'll probably hate this. Me? I'm on the lower end of mixed, for both.

Neither Vikander nor Goggins stand out. Though there was the screen debut of Daniel Wu as Lu Phen. 

Wow!,As a video game to movie adaptation Tomb Raider works on nearly every level, the only flaw being that there's so much of Tomb Raider to pack into two hours.
I had great expectations for this film and wasn't disappointed in the least. On the contrary, it was a blast from beginning to end with Alicia Vikander lending a nice touch of innocence to Lara, which is a clear nod to the 2013 game reboot which is what the film is based on.
Her tortuous relationship with her dad was predictable, but it wasn't overdone and it's a key element in the Lara story. On the other hand, we're plunged into the action right away and in that respect I was more than happy as the scenes were both exciting and typically Lara Croft. She uses keys, there are puzzles, traps,maps, evil foes and magnificent set pieces that, if you've ever played the games, will be instantly recognisable as Tomb Raider.
Much as has been said about the last two games perhaps giving a conflicted projection of Lara Croft - on the one hand a tormented soul and on the other, a ruthless killing machine. In all the games, she always killed the foes just to survive and the balance was just right here, with Alicia Vikander lending just the right amount of steely determination to the role.
More importantly, I could relate to the film having played all the games - the plane on top of the waterfall, the rolling spikes and the collapsing floor later on - all drew me in wonderfully.
I'll take two please, or preferably three!,Some of the most generic shit ever put to screen. Don't get how this was supposed to please anybody, Tomb Raider fan or otherwise.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._,""Not dead yet, no sh*t!""

Wanted to see this because I'm a long time fanboy of the game series. Liked the old movies with Angelina Jolie, perfect for a teenage boy with the humor; action and a beautiful lead actress.

Alicia Vikander delivers a solid performance combined with a more realistic plot. Great action sequences with a nice cliffhanger for a sequel.

Only downside would be the role of Daniel Wu as there was no need for a sidekick who isn't really included in the storyline.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._,Sweet enough. Just a shame it doesn't finish as great it starts.

<em>'A Wrinkle in Time'</em>, I think, starts off very nicely. It gives a satisfactory background to the main character, while it builds the intrigue well. Unfortunately, it does drop off as it goes on - but not to the point that it hindered my enjoyment, it is a noticeable step down though. I really like the special effects, I think they look terrific throughout.

Onto the cast. Storm Reid does a respectable job as Meg, her performance arguably gets better as things progress - which is the opposite to the film overall. Chris Pine is underused in his role, but the casting of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling is good - Zach Galifianakis too. I didn't actually find Deric McCabe's character, Charles Wallace, annoying like most seemingly did.

Surprised to see that this has a low rating across the board. I've never read the Madeleine L'Engle novel so perhaps that has something to do with it? I do agree the writing isn't necessarily great either.

Though people claim another film about the topic was unnecessary, I cannot agree with that fact. Most of the millennial generation have never heard of these events nor have they seen the previous cinematic efforts. To bring things to a modern audience, a film with contemporary stars is often required to garner interest in a tale that few under the age of 35 would have given much thought to. Considering the age of terrorism that we live in I didn't have an issue with the film giving a heavy amount of screen time to their motivations because if you don't understand why someone has a propensity towards acts of violence as a use of political means, how are we ever going to stop this circle from repeating itself? Good performances are put it from the leads especially Eddie Marsan and Daniel Bruhl but the screenplay is slow and ponderous and doesn't give equal weight to other perspectives and differing viewpoints of characters. it is worth remembering even the 1976 film had a reasonably sympathetic portrayal of Bose. The portrayal of the Ugandans here is two dimensional as always. It would have been more interesting to give some of them a voice and hear their views on the events they were caught up in and had absolutely no control over. As the actual Entebbe is currently a UN Airbase, its a shame the film wasn't shot at the real location because the depiction here (Shot in Malta) feels very stifled.

Any Entebbe film will stand or fall on the way the assault is depicted and here its shown extremely piece meal while inter cut with a scene of a dance connected to the girlfriend of one of the soldiers. As many others have stated as a metaphor though I can see what the director was going for it really doesn't work, makes the scene disjointed, muffles much of the sound and reduces the emotional impact of the assault and its consequences. Many aspects of the assault aren't accurate either. Wilfred and Brigette were not next to each other when they died. Yoni is depicted as begin shot during the assault but this is wrong, he was fired at afterwards during the departure while getting the hostages on the plane. A terrorist walks towards a soldier with a Grenade in each hand - this never happened, the Commandos used the grenades in the last rooms to kill the last of the terrorists. Dora Bloch's murder by the Ugandan Secret Police is lumped in with the others. as a footnote on the end titles, which feels ill fitting. The shooting of the three Israeli hostages accidentally during the raid goes almost entirely un-depicted. To have such things omitted and give the screen time no needless dance sequences just feels wrong. As others have said there is no mention of the award given to the French Captain, nor his crew. One cannot help but feel that the soul purpose of the film was to give a voice to Palestine cause and while its fine to show different view points, its not right to give so much screen time to one thing and so little screen time or indeed none at all to many other things of consequence. I missed opportunity and it has to be said, the 1976 film is superior in every way.,_**Lacks insight, but is well made**_

- Moshe Dayan; Eulogy for Roi Rotenberg (April 19, 1956)


Written by Gregory Burke (_'71_) and directed by José Padilha (_Ônibus 174_; _Tropa de Elite_; _Tropa de Elite 2_; _Robocop_), _Entebbe_ [released in North America as _7 Days in Entebbe_] has met with near universally bad reviews (22% approval on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing), and while it is without doubt flawed, it's not nearly as bad as has been made out. Telling the story of the 1976 AirFrance hijacking by Palestinian and German revolutionaries, and the subsequent Israeli Defence Force rescue mission (Operation Thunderbolt), the film is presented from multiple points of view; Revolutionäre Zellen members Brigitte Kuhlmann (Rosamond Pike) and Wilfried Böse (Daniel Brühl), Israeli Minister for Defence Shimon Peres (Eddie Marsan), Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (an excellent Lior Ashkenazi), IDF Pvt. Zeev Hirsch (Ben Schnetzer), AirFrance 1st Engineer Jacques Le Moine (Denis Ménochet), IDF Lt. Col. Yoni Netanyahu (Angel Bonanni), and Ugandan President Idi Amin (Nonso Anozie).

The problem is obvious; the film covers every point of view except the most important one; the Palestinian. Indeed, the only Palestinian given any kind of development is a fictional character played by Omar Berdouni, who talks of Israeli tanks driving over a car in which his family were trapped. And there are other strange omissions; the death of Dora Bloch (Trudy Weiss), murdered on Amin's orders after she was released in Kampala, is never mentioned, and Wadie Haddad is nowhere to be found. Additionally, the film doesn't have much of contemporaneous relevance to say in relation to the Arab-Israeli Conflict, other than alluding melancholically to the self-propagating nature of the violence, and the unlikelihood of peace (the closing legend points out that after he pushed for negotiations in 1995, Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist). However, it's aesthetically very well put together, and the juxtaposition of Thunderbolt with a Jewish dance number works much better than it has any right to. True, it doesn't get to the heart of the matter by any stretch of the imagination, and it could be accused of taking a pro-Israeli stance, but it's enjoyable enough, and worth a look.,","israel,terrorist,1970s,uganda,based on a true story,history,airplane hijacking,rescue mission,israeli defense force,terrorist group,operation entebbe,",53,98,"José Padilha,"

Personally, I watched it by myself, on a bad day, bedridden, feeling very, very unwell. And that's the experience I'm reviewing.

Movies don't have to be grounded to be good. They don't have to be be standardised to be good. They don't even have to make sense to be good. Sometimes a movie is just silly fun and everything else is moot. But most of the time, the better a movie is (ie. The more you as the individual viewer are appreciating your experience) the more nonsense you are willing to forgive. It's easier to suspend disbelief, even a great big fat disbelief, if everything else in the movie is working. If not everything is working, but you're only called upon to accept a small amount of ridiculousness, then that will generally fly. But in some movies... In some movies, there is absolutely nothing that is working, and yet those same movies will ask you for the biggest, fattest suspension of disbelief of them all. _Batman Ninja_, is one of **those** movies.

I could probably pick any one aspect I disliked about _Batman Ninja_ and write a full length review based on that single issue, but I generally try to keep these things pretty short, so rather than get into the plot, the deviation from source, the character choices, the dubbing, the animation style, the sexism, the science, the lapses in logic, the design choices, the dialogue, the nonsense, the inconsistencies within its own defined setting, the fact I was so bored at one point I literally fell asleep, or any number of the problems I've either blocked out or to list would require spoilers, I'll skip over all of that and simply say: This is the worst Batman movie I've ever seen.

TLDR

The story itself has a lot of potentials. The outcome is in short total crap. Dialogues are childish and silly. I was wondering if I saw a Power Rangers movie. Seems to me a cultural obsession of Japanese people with Robots. Instead of a focus of deep characters, too many figures made it more confusing. There was slightly nothing about Japanese culture in the movie. Somehow it seems that the whole film was produced by 8 year olds. It has to just be a Ninja movie. If you go that road just add zombies, aliens and Godzilla to it. Total trash in short. Good animations don't make up for a silly and childish fantasy.,","based on comic,anime,",17,139,"Junpei Mizusaki,"

""The Strangers: Prey At Night"" features no bigger actors, aside from Martin Henderson maybe, but therefore the director of ""47 Meters Down"" and ""The Other Side Of The Door"", movies I really enjoyed. And after seeing, he took on the second part here, I was very curious. And he really nailed it. I liked the entire family and with each one being in trouble, I felt the tension rising. The killers were basically doing what they did in the first one, so that stays true to the source material, and then we get this amazing 80s soundtrack throughout the movie. Heck, we can almost enjoy Bonnie Tyler's 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart' in its entire length, while at the same time sitting there with the eyes glued to the screen, because you don't want to miss a single detail.

> _Når en mann kan forårsake så mye ondt - tenk hvor mye kjærlighet vi kan skape sammen_ [_When one man could cause so much evil - think about how much love we can create together_].

- Stine Renate Håheim (Utøya survivor); July 23, 2011

_Utøya 22. juli_ is an aesthetically fascinating, pseudo-documentarian examination of the 2011 Utøya massacre, told from the perspective of one of the youths trapped on the island, rather than the killer, the police, the parents, or the courts. Decidedly different from Paul Greengrass's recently released Netflix film, _22 July_, the makers of _Utøya 22. juli_ have little interest in either overt political contextualisation or the aftermath of the massacre. Comparisons are, of course, inevitable, as the two films will undoubtedly prompt debate as to the ethics of recreating such a contemporary tragedy. However, what's interesting is that Greengrass isn't overly interested in the massacre itself, focusing instead on the repercussions and subsequent trial, attempting to explicate some of the far-right political motivations. In this sense, _Utøya 22. juli_ and _22 July_ complement one another in such a way as to provide a reasonably inclusive overview of the motives, the act, and the punishment. Where _Utøya 22. juli_ is especially laudable, however, is in its extraordinary and thematically justified aesthetic design, which elevates it from a fine film to a superb one.

Written by Anna Bache-Wiig and Siv Rajendram Eliassen, from a story treatment by Erik Poppe (_Tusen ganger god natt_; _Kongens nei_), who also directs, _Utøya 22. juli_ is based exclusively on the testimony of survivors, but the characters are fictional, with the protagonist a composite of several different people, experiencing on her own what they did collectively. The film begins with the detonation of a bomb near the Statsministerens kontor [Office of the Prime Minister] in Oslo. The film then jumps roughly 90 minutes forward, and about 20 miles northwest, to the Arbeidernes ungdomsfylking [Workers' Youth League] summer camp on the island of Utøya. Politically on the left, and affiliated to the Arbeiderpartiet [Labour Party], the camp is an annual event attended by roughly 600 youths. As word of the Oslo bombing slowly starts to filter through, we are introduced to Kaja (an extraordinary Andrea Berntzen), a 19-year-old with political aspirations, who is attending the camp with her younger sister Emilie (Elli Rhiannon Müller Osbourne). With Emilie patently uninterested in politics, Kaja resents having to look after her. Also introduced are Petter (Brede Fristad), a young man with a knack for pushing Kaja's political buttons; Magnus (Aleksander Holmen), an eternal optimist who has come to the island primarily to pick up girls, and who has his sights on Kaja; and Issa (Sorosh Sadat), a young Muslim who is hoping the bombing is not the work of a jihadist, as he fears it will increase the prejudice he already experiences on a daily basis. As they discuss the matter, they hear strange noises coming from the far side of the forest. Initially believing them to be firecrackers, it is only when terrified campers start rushing from the trees that they realise something more serious is happening. Taking shelter in a nearby cabin, Kaja is distraught to learn Emilie is nowhere to be found. As the sounds of gunfire get closer, the campers inside the building realise it provides no real safety, and leave. As Petter attempts to convince everyone it's probably just an elaborate safety drill, it is suggested they may be safer on the island's shoreline than in the forest. However, as that would take them even further from the campsite where Kaja last saw Emilie, she refuses to go, returning to the camp alone in an effort to find her sister.

First, as is my wont, here's a little background information. Both attacks were carried out by Anders Behring Breivik, a right-wing terrorist and possible psychopath. Roughly 90 minutes prior to the bombing, Breivik emailed over 1,000 people a 1,518-page manifesto, _2083: A European Declaration of Independence_. Essentially an amalgamation of Islamophobic, xenophobic, national conservatist, pan-nationalist, monoculturalist, misogynistic, and anti-Marxist ideologies, Breivik outlines why he believes Europe is currently experiencing the Clash of Civilisations, brought about by immigration and various refugee crises. To this end, the manifesto cites a huge number of both moderate and far-right authors, including counter-jihadists Robert Spencer and Peder Are Nøstvold Jensen (aka Fjordman); pro-Israeli Gisèle Littman (aka Bat Ye'o); Islamophobic blogger Pamela Geller; orientalist and Indologist Koenraad Elst; president of the Middle East Forum, Daniel Pipes; leader of the Partij voor de Vrijheid [Party for Freedom] in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders; and paleoconservatist Srđa Trifković. The manifesto outlines how Breivik sees himself as a knight fighting against Muslim immigration into Europe. Indeed, he very literally believes this, claiming to be a member of a ""_Christian European military order_"" called the Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici [PCCTS], which he says is a modern day reincarnation of the Knights Templar. Established in London in 2002, as an ""_anti-Jihad crusader-organisation_"" that fights ""_Islamic suppression_"", the group's goal is

> _to seize political and military control of Western European multiculturalist regimes and to try, judge and punish Western European cultural Marxist/multiculturalist perpetrators for crimes committed against the indigenous peoples of Europe._

According to _2083_, there are between 15 and 80 ""Justiciar Knights"" operational in Western Europe, supported by a network of civilian members across all walks of life. However, no evidence has ever been found to suggest the PCCTS is real.

The Oslo bomb killed eight and injured 209. Roughly 90 minutes later, Breivik, dressed as a policeman, boarded the ferry for Utøya. Presenting himself as performing a routine check on the camp following the bombing, he was met by camp leader and island hostess, Monica Bøsei. Becoming suspicious, Bøsei called Trond Berntsen, the island's security officer and half-brother of Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway, but Breivik killed them both, firing his first shot at 17:22. Using hollow-point bullets to increase tissue damage, Breivik repeatedly shouted, ""_You are going to die today, Marxists_."" At 18:01, he called emergency services to surrender, but hung up, and continued shooting. At 18:25, the Beredskapstroppen [Emergency Response Unit] arrived on Utøya, and one minute later, Breivik again called to surrender, again hanging up. At 18:34, 72 minutes since the first shot had been fired, Breivik was arrested. 69 people were dead, and 110 were injured, with the ages of the dead ranging from 14 to 51.

Although there was talk of charging Breivik with high treason or crimes against humanity, he was instead indicted on domestic terrorism charges. He readily admitted his culpability in both attacks, but denied criminal guilt, citing a defence of ""necessity"" (in legal terms, necessity refers to an argument that the defendant had no option but to break the law, so as to prevent a greater harm). A major aspect of the trial was whether Breivik could be deemed criminally insane. Examined by a team of forensic psychologists, they concluded he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, and was psychotic when he carried out the attacks. However, under pressure from the victims' families, the court ordered a second evaluation. This time, it was determined that he suffered from antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, but he was not psychotic during the massacre. Upon being found guilty, he was sentenced to 21 years in a maximum security prison, with the option to have his sentence extended in five-year increments if he is still deemed a threat to society (the maximum sentence allowed by Norwegian law).

In 2012, the _Gjørv-rapporten_ [_Gjørv Report_] was published. The official results of a fact-finding commission ordered by the Norwegian government, the _Rapporten_ found that police could have prevented the bombing, should have reached Utøya sooner, and should have caught Breivik faster. The Oslo police became aware of the shooting at 17:25, three minutes after the first shot, and the Beredskapstroppen was dispatched from Oslo at 17:30. Local police reached the ferry point at 17:55 but were ordered to wait until the arrival of the team from Oslo. They reached the ferry point at 18:09, but were forced to wait for a suitable boat to take them to Utøya. However, the inflatable boat that was procured was too small for the amount of personnel and equipment, and the engine cut-out during the crossing. They then transferred to two privately owned boats in the vicinity, reaching the island at 18:25. The _Rapporten_ stated that police should have been on the island by 18:00 at the latest. It also cited a phone-call made by a civilian 10 minutes after the bombing, giving police a description of Breivik, and alerting them to the fact that he was armed and wearing protective clothing. However, the police failed to act on the information. The _Rapporten_ also alluded to the fact that the country's only police helicopter was not used during the massacre, because its crew were on vacation. Øystein Mæland, director of the Politidirektoratet [National Police Directorate] resigned in the wake of the _Rapporten_.

So much for background. Although dealing with a politically motivated incident _Utøya 22. juli_ is a relatively apolitical film, in the sense of Gus Van Sant's overly-simplistic _Elephant_ (2003) or Paul Greengrass's superb _United 93_ (2006). It simply has no interest in contextualising the event within a larger socio-political or socio-historical framework. It doesn't investigate why Breivik did what he did, what specifically set him off, or what happened to him afterwards. It is instead a homage to the young people upon whom he focused his aggression. In filtering the event through the fictional character of Kaja, Poppe is able to narrativise it, and thus render it emotionally compelling. Of course, it could, and probably will be argued that no such emotional restructuring is necessary, as the event, in and of itself, is emotionally traumatic enough, and using a fictional protagonist is distasteful and disrespectful.

However, to counter this argument, the film was made in consultation with numerous survivors of the massacre. In a BBC interview, Poppe stated that he chose to use fictional characters in order to

> _make a reflection of what happened out there, as close as possible to what I learned. There were ethical reasons for me to tell a fictionalised story. It would be hard for the survivors to watch the film if they thought these people were friends who had been killed._

Speaking to _The Guardian_ at the world première, one of the survivors, Ingrid Endredrud, said,

> _this film is so important because it captures what right-wing extremism can lead to. This is hate in its purest form and as a society, we have to stand together against it. For me, the reason for helping with this film is because it tells the story which for so many of us has been impossible to tell. I've only been able to tell my experience with a great deal of distance and that's where film can offer another way of preserving an important part of Norway's history._

Also speaking to _The Guardian_, Poppe states,

> _my overall aim by making the film was not to traumatise people, but to help the healing process._

In this sense, rather than proving exploitative, the film is instead both necessary and cathartic. Indeed, private screenings were held around Norway to which survivors and families and friends of victims were invited, and Poppe sought their approval of every aspect of the film before releasing it.

As Endredrud alludes to above, however, the film is not _entirely_ apolitical. The opening and closing legends both cite far-right thinking (the kind of people who don't understand the difference between nationalism and xenophobia, or patriotism and jingoism), and Poppe makes certain we know this is a condemnation of such an ideology. However, he wisely chooses not to ram this condemnation down our throats, nor even to foreground it. Instead, he simply lets the extremist ideology speak for itself, and, as is so often the case with far-right (and far-left) thinking, the doctrine condemns itself. Perhaps the most salient political point in the film is that we are forced to see in specifics an incident which we tend to think of as an abstraction; it's one thing to say 69 people died. It's disassociated, depersonalised, a statistic. However, it's something else entirely to see some of those people die. In this sense, the film is an exceptionally effective condemnation of gun violence.

Related to this is an aesthetic point that bleeds into the political; Breivik is seen only once, from a great distance, silhouetted against the horizon. Instead of showing him, the film is rigidly tied to Kaja's perspective throughout. In the wake of the real event, the 69 dead and the hundreds of injured and traumatised were anonymous, with Breivik occupying all the headlines. The film inverts this so that we focus on the victims, with the perpetrator denied any agency. As Poppe tells the BBC, he felt it was ""_morally questionable_"" to devote any time to ""_portraiting_"" Breivik; ""_the last thing I wanted was to give him more social media fame. I wanted it to be a story about the victims_."" Recalling how Terrence Malick initially introduces the Japanese soldiers on Guadalcanal in _The Thin Red Line_ (1998), Breivik is not afforded any kind of pathology, interiority, psychological verisimilitude, or even a bogeyman status. Instead, he is disembodied. In fact, his name is never mentioned once, not even in the opening or closing legends. Instead, he exists more in the aural realm than the visual one, a more obvious presence in the sound design by Gisle Tveito (_Trolljegeren_; _Turist_; _Thelma_) than Martin Otterbeck's cinematography. Primarily, this consists of the constant gunfire heard throughout the film. With no score or soundtrack to punctuate the story beats, the never-ending cracking of gunfire has a cumulatively oppressive and terrifying effect, disorientating both characters and audience.

Aesthetically, however, the film is exemplary beyond its sound design. For example, in reality, from the time of the first gun-shot to Breivik's arrest, 72 minutes passed. In the film, from the time we hear the first gunshot to the film cutting to black, exactly 72 minutes pass. Additionally, we hear the exact same number of gunshots as Breivik fired in real-life, 186. However, where it is most audacious is that the 72-minute sequence (encompassing the entire film save for the brief opening scene, which shows real security camera footage of the Oslo bombing) is made to look like a single-shot, with the edits hidden, à la Alejandro González Iñárritu's _Birdman: or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)_ (2014). The film was shot in one take on five successive days, acting out the same scenario each day. Poppe and his editor, Einar Egeland (_Kongens nei_), then edited extracts from each day together, hiding the cuts behind camera movement or darkness on screen. Coupled with this, everything is filmed hand-held, eschewing the pseudo-stability given by the use of a Steadicam.

Together, the hand-held nature of the cinematography, the single-shot effect, and the real-time structure work to establish a pseudo-documentarian verisimilitude, as if the camera is literally capturing these events as they are really happening in a _cinéma vérité_ manner (it's worth noting that Otterbeck has thus far worked primarily on documentaries). In this sense, the fabula is as unmediated as possible, recalling some of Ernest Hemingway's short stories, such as ""Hills Like White Elephants"" or ""The Killers"" (both 1927). In essence, the lack of obvious editing, the absence of well-blocked compositions and predetermined camera positions, and the real-time sense of immediacy all work to occlude any impression of either an omnipresent artifice, or an omniscient authorial voice.

Instead, the film works as much as possible to inculcate the viewer into the event. This creates a prominent experiential plane, as the audience is made to consider what it must have been like to be involved in this nightmare – we see and share the panic as the characters peer out from behind cover, race to get to safety, or collapse onto the ground in exhaustion. In this way, the film avoids being exciting in any conventional sense; what we are witnessing is instead deeply traumatic, and the experience for a viewer is an ordeal, almost an endurance test. Rarely has the artifice of a single-take been this thematically justified (contrast, for example, its gimmicky usage in Sebastian Schipper's _Victoria_), and rather than the single-take structure serving as its own rationale, Poppe uses it to subvert genre expectations and defamiliarise the narrative, all in the name of preventing the audience from attaining any comforting sense of normality.

Adding to all of this is the brilliantly naturalistic acting, especially from Andrea Berntzen, who is an absolute revelation as Kaja. When she returns to the campsite looking for Emilie, for example, all she finds is Emilie's mobile phone, and Tobias (Magnus Moen), a traumatised child of 10 or 11. Her increasing desperation and despair are flawlessly conveyed by Berntzen, and as she searches Emilie's tent, she suddenly realises Breivik is close-by. She freezes, and we hear his footsteps moving past the tent. This scene is legitimately one of the tensest and most terrifying scenes I've seen in a long time, generating infinitely more dread than any supernatural hijinx, and Berntzen's acting is a large part of that. This is also true in an utterly heart-breaking telephone conversation with her mother, where she apologises for not being able to find Emilie. Equally as poignant is a scene where she encounters a severely wounded girl (Solveig Koløen Birkeland) who asks Kaja to tell her mother she loves her. The acting from both Berntzen and Birkeland here is extraordinary, and this short scene serves as perhaps the most disturbingly real in the entire film.

A final point on the film's aesthetic design concerns the opening few seconds of the 72-minute sequence, which begins with a superbly conceived bit of visual trickery that, like everything else in the film, is thematically justified. As the camera approaches Kaja from behind, she turns around and looks directly into the lens, saying ""_You'll never understand_."" This seems a challenge as much as an assertion, directed at the audience, in a breaking of the fourth wall, articulating that the upcoming carnage will defy rationality. However, after a moment, she turns her head and we see she is wearing an earpiece. It then quickly becomes apparent that she's talking to her mother, and her comment was diegetic – when she looked into the camera, she wasn't addressing the audience, it was simply the direction in which she was looking. This simple but effective moment knocks the audience immediately off balance, alerting us to the artifice of the film in an almost _Verfremdungseffekt_, before then shifting 180 degrees away from that apparent moment of self-reflexivity and immersing us completely into the _fabula_.

Of course, the film is not perfect, and Poppe does misjudge a couple of elements. For example, the tragedy on display is, in and of itself, overwhelming, and for the most part, he remains detached. However, on occasion, he does feel the need to foreground sentimental aspects which don't work and are unnecessary. The most egregious example is towards the end of the film as Kaja and Magnus are trying to hide. To take their mind off what's happening they talk about their future plans (she wants to be a politician; he wants to be an actor). However, when he finds out she's a singer, he urges her to sing for him, which she reluctantly does, choosing Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors"" (1986). It's a fairly mawkish scene (really, all its lacking is a ""Cry now"" prompt), it doesn't accomplish anything, and it comes across as manipulative and deliberately scripted, a concession to the rules of cinematic drama, lapsing into the traditional generic signposting that the film has mostly avoided up to this point. The scene instead serves to cheapen the experience of documentary realism, with the constructed artifice's fictional foundation becoming apparent.

Another issue is related to the film sticking rigidly to Kaja's perspective. For the most part, this works to the narrative's thematic advantage. Obviously, a film about a person hiding for 72 minutes wouldn't be very interesting, or say much of relevance. With this in mind, Kaja moves around a lot, encountering various people, and it becomes a little repetitive and episodic in places. Because she is a composite of several people, her experiences are used by the filmmakers to give the viewer something of an overview of the panic and suffering. However, for one person to encounter all of these characters and have such varying experiences does strain credibility just a tad.

However, these are relatively minor criticisms, and overall, this is a superb film, as aesthetically inventive as it is emotionally devastating, as politically aware as it is historically important. It will be sure to prompt heated debate about whether such an event should be used to provide the source material for a film, especially this soon after the fact. Some will argue it's a dignified memorial, whilst others will see it as fundamentally exploitative and disrespectful. Personally, I see it as a vital text for Norway, capturing the essence of the most traumatic event the country has experienced since World War II. If people can let go of their notions of ""cinema as entertainment"", and try to embrace more of a ""cinema as art"" approach, it will become much easier to accept the film for what it is, and to realise that Poppe and his screenwriters genuinely have something important to say about the massacre, and, more specifically, about the _experience_ of the massacre. The last three or four minutes are utterly devastating, and really drive home the senseless loss of life and the innate randomness of what happened. However, Poppe's main goal is to show the audience the bravery of these people, to honour them. Evil, the film suggests, is banal. Compassion and valour are much more worthy of our attention.,","norway,based on a true story,terrorism,",13,10,"Erik Poppe,"

The post-apocalyptic story would've worked best on it's own, and the love story is kind of a distraction if you are looking for a post-apocalypse film.  The love story works well within the frame work of the post-apocalypse drama, but it's not often that people who like genre films will enjoy a straight romantic drama added into the mix.  I personally thought the two stories worked well together, but the film had several faults.

First off some of the acting was a bit dodgy, mainly in the love story.  I didn't always completely believe the love between the two leads, especially from Grégory Fitoussi.  Brittany Ashworth who plays Juliette was much better, especially in the post-apoc story.

One of the other big problems was trying to understand what connected the two stories.  I spent most of the film guessing grand twists, and was disappointed when the twist was actually really small and a bit silly. The classic problem with films that straddle the before and after of an extinction level event is you have to give enough time for the story to naturally play out.  Instead in the film it seems like society completely collapses into a desert waste land in about 18 months.  

It's like films that are set 15 years in the future.  Your audience will watch the film now and in 15 years point out all the things that haven't come to pass, let's call it the Back to the Future effect.  And this is one of the flaws of this film, Juliette doesn't look significantly aged enough for this future to be as bad as it is.  Not enough time can possibly pass for the world to completely fall apart.  Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but it took me out of the film a lot.

All in all, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.

From the Irish editor turned documentary filmmaker will take you on an interstellar journey. I am not talking about the scripted feature films with plenty of pleasant visuals. This is real. The real life human effort to see and learn about the universe. It was the first of its kind attempted, and so far only attempt. The film reveals many secrets that you might have not heard before in any space documentaries you have seen. What's special about it is the releasing on the 40th anniversary since the launch of the rockets.

Well, there are real footages. But not exactly the real ones. Originally they are stills. The spacecraft took a series of picture, those received pictures were put together and formed into the video clips. Or you could say they ran it fast, so it looked like a video. Black and white to colourised, they have done a pretty nice work on that. Though there were many CGI works too for our better understanding what's going on. Like when the spacecraft travelling in the space, you can't send another one to keep picturing it from a pretty close distance like in the filmmaking what a cameraman does with the actors. That's how you would see the voyager's journey here.

Like any documentaries, this too was a series of interview based film. That would never change for this genre. There were no Brian Cox or Neil DeGrasse Tyson to narrate the space story. But Carl Sagan himself was present with his 80s, 90s press conference footages that are given regarding the latest Voyager's breakthrough. And many people who worked on the project given some precious information and their experience being one of the first to witness the historical pictures. It is a must to observe their expressions, the story that came straight from the source, stunningly.

The year was 1977. The man was already been on the Moon. The next attempt should have been the Mars. But that's another NASA story. They wanted beyond that, to see the actual universe. The technology was pretty good, though nothing like the present generation. But the great feast is, it was nearly half a century old attempt with outdated technology, yet round the year, every day, hour, minute, never it have ever had taken a rest. Travelling at the speed of 10 miles per second, it took 35 years to get out of out solar system bubble.

> ❝It's a pretty small spacecraft, and it's a pretty big universe.❞

Each phase of the Voyager's journey was breathtaking. It targeted the last four planets of our solar system. Started off with big brother, Jupiter. It was just a passing by and having a close look at the gas giant. Also spied at all of its moons. Then the Saturn, the guy with an icy ring. I really learnt lots about them. Particularly being first visual evidence of such phenomena.

Then came the surprise. I never knew Uranus, as well as Neptune has rings. Being a space geek, I disappointed myself there. Then they said, this guy is not a photogenic. Yep, he was not. He was too plain. But its moons were another surprise. Like the scared villains from the western films. Particularly, Miranda. Maybe my favourite moon from all of our solar system for being so different. Especially it reminded me 'The Little Prince'. Going to the final guy, Neptune, everybody got emotional, for it is being the final stop.

That was the last of our solar system. But I anticipated something about Pluto, the dwarf guy. These all happened like less than 20 years, but what came after was only an empty space within our solar system. Like it took next 15 years to exit the bandwidth of our sun. But what I guess is that there would have been some planets beyond Pluto in the ancient time, which some time later had escaped from the Sun's gravity to become the rogue planets. Because they were too far from the Sun and those empty spaces would not have been there without any reason. Is not it?

The man is not on board, but his creation reached farthest. Now travelling between the stars, nobody knows what comes next. But the Voyager still in touch with the Earth with low signal. I have known about this project since my teenage. But till now I never knew there were two Voyagers. That took me by a surprise. I have known about the on board music, map, human anatomical structure et cetera. It is obviously to make contact with other intelligence in the universe.

The Voyagers will travel thousands of years into deep space. From all, nobody knows or can predict the result of such unique space project the human has ever conducted. I think there's a possible that this documentary would feature in the upcoming Oscars. I'll be definitely happy for that. It is about the NASA's achievements. The Americans would be proud of it. But the world has too. After all, we're all the human's of the Earth. A must see documentary film by everyone.

> _I had a line that used to end the film but I ended up cutting it out. It said: ""film is the art of conjuring ghosts, not getting rid of them."" I used to think filming could act like a kind of catharsis and exorcism: you film to try to get something off your chest so that you can get rid of it. But I never found it to play out that way, because by making a film you're essentially creating a ghost that you're going to live and travel around the world with, and talk to people about. Essentially, you're making something that will live on - you're not getting rid_ _of anything. So, it wasn't really cathartic at all. That said, I already felt a certain peace in my relationship with my father before I started making the film. I wasn't in a turmoil trying to work it out, so to speak. But I did feel like there was some unfinished business to attend to, and I wanted to know more about him and his world, and looking back I feel as though I did build something which now has its own existence in the world, and there's something really satisfying about that. But it’s always an unfinished process. I was thinking a lot about the idea of reconciliation when I was making the film. Reconciliation between me and my father, between North and South, between his time and mine. I thought a lot about what it is like to place one image next to another. There's always something missing in between, a weirdly primal desire of wanting to make a whole out of what is not. It's almost like the idea of going back to the womb - a certain desire that can never truly be fulfilled._

For me, if a documentary gets a theatrical release, there must be a tangible reason as to why. By that I mean, why was it released in the cinema, as opposed to on television, which, in terms of how audiences engage with the mediums, is a more natural home for the documentary form, where a film can find a much larger audience over a longer period of time. There needs to be something, anything, that makes the documentary inherently cinematic in some way. The majority of documentaries don't provide such a reason. For example, two films that spring to mind are Dror Moreh's _The Gatekeepers_ (2012) and Laura Poitras's _Risk_ (2016). _The Gatekeepers_ is about Shin Bet, whilst _Risk_ tells the story of Julian Assange's self-imposed exile in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The first, which I actually quite enjoyed as a documentary, is a series of visually drab talking-head interviews with the six still-living former-heads of Shin Bet, and the second is a poorly edited and narratively confused valorisation of its subject. Neither feature anything to justify their theatrical release. Compare this to documentaries as varied as, say, Kevin Macdonald's _One Day in September_ (1999) or José Padilha's _Ônibus 174_ (2002), with their thriller-esque narratives, plot-twists, heroes, villains, and governmental corruption and conspiracy; David Sington's _The Fear of 13_ (2015), which, despite consisting entirely of an interview with one person, is visually and aurally fascinating; Werner Herzog's _Cave of Forgotten Dreams_ (2010), as aesthetically perfect a documentary as you're ever likely to see, especially if seen in the intended 3D format; or Emer Reynolds's _The Farthest_ (2017), with its awe-inspiring and deeply emotional story of the 1977 Voyager space probes.

I've spent this first paragraph giving a rather wordy introduction as I want to be clear about where I'm coming from regarding my problems with _The Image You Missed_ – sadly, it is never able to justify its theatrical release; the whole time I was watching it, I was thinking to myself ""why is this being shown in the cinema?"" I say ""sadly"" because I really wanted to like it; it's a low budget documentary that takes a deeply personal approach to an inherently Irish political situation of which any Irish person over the age of thirty will have memories, and, depending on your political leanings, is either a source of great pride or deeply held shame. In short, there's a lot to root for here. Essentially, the film is a ""dialogue"" between director Donal Foreman and his dead father, Arthur MacCaig. An Irish-American born in New Jersey in 1948, MacCaig came to Belfast as a tourist in the early years of the Troubles, and remained fascinated with the city and the political situation as a documentarian, living first in Paris, and eventually in Belfast itself. Interested in exploring the disparity between the tribal, religious-based conflict depicted in British and American media, with what he saw as a more non-sectarian struggle between ""coloniser"" and ""colonised"", MacCaig's unapologetically Republican stance soon earned him extraordinary access to the IRA (indeed, when he died, he had a pseudo-Republican funeral – Danny Morrison and Sinn Féin PRO Joe Austin spoke, whilst Gerry Adams attended).

MacCaig's best-known film is _The Patriot Game_, a feature-length 1979 documentary made for French television, which uses street-interviews and IRA-insider material to chart the history of conflict in the province of Ulster from the formation of the Northern Irish state in 1922. Critically, the film was a modest international success, with _The Chicago Reader_'s B. Ruby Rich calling it ""_the best overview of the Northern Irish conflict that we've seen_,"" and _The Village Voice_'s J. Hoberman citing it as ""_vivid, informative, and partisan_."" Closer to home, _The Guardian_'s Kevin J. Kelley praised it for ""_debunking the twin myths that the IRA is a 'terrorist organisation' fighting 'a religious war'._"" As is mentioned in _The Image You Missed_, when the British Foreign Office warned its embassies that _The Patriot Game_ was ""_damaging and highly critical of Her Majesty's Government_,"" MacCaig welcomed it as ""_the best review I ever had_.""

MacCaig died in Belfast in 2008, when Foreman was 22. Raised in the North Strand area of Dublin by his mother, Foreman only met MacCaig a handful of times. Nevertheless, they had reconciled a few months before MacCaig died, and after the funeral, Foreman travelled to an apartment MacCaig owned in Paris to go through his belongings. Much to his surprise, he unearthed over one-hundred hours of never-before-seen documentary footage, and the idea for _The Image You Missed_ was born, as Foreman essentially tries to engage in a conversation with MacCaig by way of cutting between MacCaig's footage and his own, directly addressing his dead father, and reading in voiceover letters written by MacCaig (indeed, the whole enterprise could be labelled epistolary in design).

In this sense, both the poster and the opening credit read ""_A Film Between Donal Foreman | Arthur MacCaig_"". Not ""a film by"", or ""a film about"", but ""a film between"". The official website describes the film as a ""_documentary essay_"", and this cannot be overemphasised. This is, at the most basic level, a film in which someone still living attempts to 'communicate' with someone already dead (although not, obviously, in a séance kind of way). With that in mind, the film has no discernible narrative as such, using editing to juxtapose, contrast, comment upon, and suggest thematic links between the footage shot by the father and that shot by the son. The narrative jumps back and forth fairly randomly amongst MacCaig's footage, employing what could be termed ""thematic editing"". There's also no real central character; the documentary is not 'about' either man in the classic sense of the term; it's about the space between them.

Unfortunately, for me, it just didn't work. Apart from the already alluded to lack of theatrical justification, which really can't be overstated, one of the biggest problems was the failure to contextualise anything on screen; the tendency to jump in and out of scenes without even remotely attempting to suture the viewer into the _milieu_. Granted, it makes no claims to be an informative historical overview, but the viewer still needs to be situated in some way, shape, or form in relation to what they're watching. Foreman doesn't use the backdrop of the Troubles to inform the dialogue between himself and MacCaig, but neither does he use that dialogue to inform the presentation of the Troubles, so the fact that the film is set in Belfast is, bizarrely, and quite paradoxically, kind of irrelevant. Foreman, however, has argued that the interaction between the personal and the political is a central connective tissue in the film; speaking to _The Irish Times_, he states,

> _if it had been just about my father and my relationship with my father, without those added layers about politics and history and cinema to engage with, I don't think I would have made the film. I saw his archive as a pretext to grapple with a lot of interesting questions and challenge myself as a film-maker to deal with political questions that I hadn't found a way to do in my films before._

Unfortunately, there's little evidence of this in the film, with the Troubles never being examined beyond that of an intermittent surface-level presentation.

Tied to this is the single biggest issue I had with the film, a question I found myself asking after about twenty minutes – why should I, or anyone else, care that Foreman had a tough relationship with his father? Who doesn't? I wouldn't expect anyone to sit through a documentary in which I work out my daddy issues, not unless those issues speak to a more all-encompassing truth, and I'm really not sure why Foreman should be any different, as he certainly provides no such reason in the film. And precisely because he _doesn't_ allow the personal and the political to inform one another, the film just comes across as a guy with a camera watching old footage shot by his dad.

Maybe I didn't respond correctly to the form, maybe I wasn't the target demographic (at the screening I attended, I was the youngest person in the cinema by a good ten or fifteen years at least, and I'm 40), I'm not sure, but whatever the case, I was just left wondering as to what the purpose of any of it was.,",,1,4,"Donal Foreman,"

He mixes his mother's stories with his own memories and those of his siblings, some of whom hear for the first time what their mother had to say about them.

A loose adaptation of Johann Wolfgang von Goethes epistolary novel 'The Sorrows of Young Werther', the opera is conducted by Germanys Cornelius Meister. It tells the story of the impossible union of poet Werther to Charlotte, a woman of duty already promised to a wealthy businessman. Goethes drama is echoed in Massenets score by emotionally wide-ranging vocal parts written on a grand scale. Juan Diego Flórez is undisputedly one of the best belcanto tenors of our times and embodies a tortured and nuanced Werther. 'Its not a profane appearance of any singer it is an epiphany!' gushes the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in a rave review. At Flórezs side, Franco-British mezzo-soprano Anna Stéphany sang her role début as Charlotte. The one-room staging by Tatjana Gürbaca cleverly makes the social stranglehold of oppression tangible.",0.6,/a7WcHoNmvqXceXm4oqwKWEkbeqU.jpg,2018-03-30,0,138,Released,,Massenet: Werther,False,0.0,0,,,,,,0,,,4,1,"Tatjana Gürbaca,"

The story is that of a young Parisian whose parents have found a good match for him, a count’s daughter. But when he goes to visit her in her country home, the handsome boy – whose Parisian manners are far removed from the rules of decorum that reign in the provinces – cannot open his heart to his lovely intended. Stung, the latter decides to punish his arrogance while a former lover arrives to prevent the marriage.
