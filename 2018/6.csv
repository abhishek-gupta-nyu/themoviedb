It's an embarrassing fever dream. I abandoned it halfway through its runtime.,More dinosaurs, Opie’s hot daughter, Dracula’s castle and Indiana Jones

 “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” (2018) revolves around Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen (Chris Pratt) leading a team back to Isla Nublar to save several species of dinosaurs after an active volcano threatens all life there. The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, but that’s not the way it works out.

My title blurb pretty much says it all for this fifth film in the franchise. I mention Indiana Jones because the movie has a “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981) vibe more so than the other movies. The reference to Dracula’s castle is due to the fact that the entire second half takes place at a cool, gothic chateau in Northern California and there’s a scene with a genetically-enhanced raptor acting like Dracula.

Curvy Bryce is just stunning throughout and easily blows away any other woman in the series. Meanwhile Pratt seriously upped his game as leading action hero (I wasn’t overly impressed with him in the previous film, although I didn’t dislike him either). At the end of the day I’d have to rank this installment as my favorite, followed by the original 1993 movie and 2015’s “Jurassic World.”

The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in Hawaii and England/Scotland.

GRADE: A-/B+,As a kid dinosaurs was one of my great interests. Thus I was so thrilled by the first Jurassic Park movie, which I thought then, and still think today, is a great movie. Sadly the following movies have been a mixed bag to say the least.

This movie falls in the “that was disappointing” category I am afraid. It is obviously that however wrote the story was a lazy bugger that simply rehashed old bits and standard Hollywood cheap concepts and then added some frustrating preaching to it.

The two scenes, one at the beginning and one in the end, where Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) was just sitting and ranting on and on was enough by itself to drag down the movie a star or two. We get it, however wrote that crap do not like gene science. Then go and write a piece in a science journal or something. Oh wait, it would not have been excepted since there was no science in it, just ranting mixed up with poorly hidden religious beliefs. So instead you had to go and ruin a movie which was meant to simply entertain.

The we have the rest of the story. The best, or should I say the kindest, word for describing it would be “predictable”. How many times are we going to do the big company captures animals for profit story? At least try to put some intelligence in the plot if you have to rehash it over and over again. It has even been done before in the same franchise for Christ sake!

I would lie if I did not say that I found, at least, some entertainment watching the movie though. But pretty much all of it came from watching the scenery and the special effects. They at least were pretty good. But then I do like big monsters stomping around wreaking havoc and eating people, especially when it is the bad guys.

There were some parts that was rather funny. I think Christ Pratt, and most of the other actors as well for that matter, did a fairly good job out of the lousy script. The idea of using a Stygimoloch to break free was quite cool and the havoc he wreaked somewhat funny. The part where Wheatley stop in the middle of all the chaos to extract a tooth as a bloody trophy was just silly though.

The end scenes was just frustrating. However wrote that ought to be shot. A few dinosaurs escape and then the conclusion is that humanity have to live side by side with dinosaurs from then one. What a load of rubbish!

Sadly, despite the genre being a favorite of mine and the special effects being pretty good, this film did not make it for me due to the unintelligent and lazy script.,A strong, **strong** opening that it never recovers* from.

(*""never recovers from"" here meaning ""never stops dissapointing afterwards"".)

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._,Cover Version 2

It was 1993 when Jurassic Park was unleashed upon the film loving public, spawning a blockbuster franchise and pop culture thunders in the process. Sadly we now find ourselves suffering cover versions of what was once a great and thought provoking premise with high octane thrills into the bargain.

I guess once they started personalising the Velociraptors, making one of them a friend of man, it was the beginning of the end. But we accepted it - sort of - jumping into 2015's Jurassic World with carefree abandon. More dino carnage we wanted, a bright cast fronted by the ever likable Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard drew us in, but it was merely ok, a franchise entry that was just a quick fix but nothing more. But of course box office talks and the franchise lumbers on to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom...

Plot returns to Isla Nublar which along with all the dinosaur inhabitants is about to be vanished from the planet by the mother of all volcanoes. Cue mankind jostling over whether to save a species that was once extinct whilst others have nefarious motives for financial gain.

Off we go then, stock characters that are over familiar are performed by different actors but go through motions we have witnessed before, whilst the writing strains for a sort of human empathy factor that never hits the mark. There is nothing remotely fresh (well Howard has at least changed her footwear to something more credible) or exciting on offer here, it's a tired cash cow that's in dire need of extinction itself.

Naturally another instalment will come along, and naturally it will make money, with myself and the other millions of Jurassic zombies filing in to view what we hope will be a return to the heady days back in 1993. But it's most likely a forlorn hope, so maybe, just maybe, it should be enough now, enough?  5/10,Brain hurt. Me no likey. Err...umm...ahem.

This is a movie that really stretches it as far as believability, logic, or even physics.

First, just a quick note: The trailer makes it seem like the movie spends its time on an island about to blow up. Less than half the movie is that. So, if you're looking for a long drawn out volcanic eruption, look elsewhere.

The heroes are annoying and dumb caricatures, from the techie who's afraid of everything to the wisecracking animal wrangler (in fairness, this is Chris Pratt's character from the previous film, but still). The villains are short-sighted, moustache-twirling dolts who never seem to remember to watch behind them, especially in dangerous scenarios. And why was Jeff Goldblum even in this movie? He serves no purpose to the story. None at all. He's there for them to say, ""See! We have someone from the older movies, so it ties together."" That's literally all he's there to do for his two minutes of screen time.

It's the same plot as every other Jurassic Park/World film. Let's create/genetically engineer dinosaurs. What could possibly go wrong? Even the supposed ""plot twist"" could be figured out from the very beginning of the film. Basic physics don't even apply, such as the impossible truck jump at one point. I swear I could feel my brain leaking out of my ears while watching this.

This film honestly makes me somewhat relieved that Colin Trevorrow got removed from Star Wars Episode IX. Unfortunately, the way this movie ends basically guarantees that there's going to be another one. Although it begs the question about what happened to Jurassic Park III since it ends in a similar way. Is that film even supposed to be canon anymore?

Just don't bother. Even if you love the dinosaur special effects of previous films, there's really not much here that you didn't see before, and some of it is actually pretty bad and unbelievable for a film from 2018. Just don't bother.,I spent half the time scoffing at the plot Jurassic World 2 was throwing at me, which diluted the fun I was having by looking at the superb CGI, moderate man-dinosaur action, and an overall fine cast performance. It still is a lot worse than Jurassic World (2015), which had a story almost as good as the original, the legendary Jurassic Park (1993) which almost seems impossible to mimic or better today.

<em>'Incredibles 2'</em> isn't too far away from the preceding film, which is always a big plus for a follow-up. This one is definitely the more funnier of the two, there are some very amusing moments; especially with Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile/Nick Bird).

From a plot point of view, the antagonists are better though unfortunately they do go down the obvious direction with them. I felt a few pacing issues too, it's a slow burner. The animation is very solid, as are the voice cast.

Speaking of the cast, all of the main lot return with the exception of  Spencer Fox (Dash) - whose absence I didn't really notice in truth. Everyone's as good as they are in the original, while the additions of Winston (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn (Catherine Keener) are welcomed. There's also a small yet nice role for Odenkirk's <em>'Better Call Saul'</em> co-star Jonathan Banks (Dicker).

This does some things greater than <em>'The Incredibles'</em>, but other things less so. Nevertheless, it's a very respectable Disney sequel.,Doesn't hold a candle to the original _Incredibles_, and it's like... **really** on the nose, but _Incredibles 2_ is still a good time.

_Sicario 2: Soldado_ [released in North America as _Sicario: Day of the Soldado_] is a sequel to Denis Villeneuve's _Sicario_ (2015). And if ever a film didn't scream ""sequel"", it was that one. Apart from the fact that it was only a modest box-office hit (grossing $84.9 million against a $30 million budget, in an era when the only films that become franchises must gross $800 billion in the first five minutes of their release), the storyline was carried to a fairly natural conclusion – Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro), protected by his CIA handler Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), successfully manipulated naïve and idealistic CIRG officer Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) into helping him exact revenge for the murder of his wife and daughter at the hands of drug baron Fausto Alarcón (Julio Cesar Cedillo). The film concluded with Graver getting what he wanted, Gillick getting revenge, and Macer in possession of a more realistic, if bitter, understanding of how the US conducts its affairs in Mexico.

A sequel felt wholly unnecessary. But a sequel is what we have. When a suicide bombing in Kansas kills fifteen people, the US government authorise Graver to adopt ""_extreme measures_"" to combat Mexican drug cartels, who are suspected of smuggling the terrorists across the border. Deciding to instigate a war between the two major cartels, Graver recruits Gillick to assassinate a high-profile lawyer for the Matamoros cartel while Graver and his team kidnap Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner), the daughter of the kingpin of Matamoros' rival. Taking her to Texas, Graver and Gillick then 'rescue' her in a false flag operation, making it appear she was kidnapped by her father's enemies. As they transport her back to Mexico, Gillick begins to bond with her. However, after they cross the border, the Mexican police escorts double-cross them, and Isabel flees into the desert, pursued by Gillick. Meanwhile, the US government determines that two of the suicide bombers from Kansas were domestic terrorists, and thus were not smuggled into the country. With this mind, to help quell tensions with Mexico, Secretary of Defense James Riley (Matthew Modine) orders the CIA to abandon the mission, much to Garver's disgust.

With the first film wrapping up so neatly, the announcement of a sequel seemed like a typical Hollywood cash grab, one which would most likely crap all over the legacy of the truly excellent original. However, as bits and pieces of info regarding the sequel began to filter through, it started to feel less and less like the usual Hollywood knock-off we're all used to seeing. For starters, Taylor Sheridan would return as sole-writer, in a script that would not go in what, for many, might seem the only real direction in which to take the story - Macer getting revenge for Graver and Gillick using her. Instead, Macer wouldn't even appear, as the script would instead focus on pseudo-antagonists Gillick and Graver. To this end, the only other actors who would also return would be Raoul Max Trujillo as Rafael, one of Gillick's contacts in Mexico, and Jeffrey Donovan as Steve Foraing, Graver's number two. The big concern for a lot of people, however, was who would replace the irritatingly talented Villeneuve in the director's chair. And so it was another welcome bit of news when the man chosen was Stefano Sollima, the Italian director of _A.C.A.B. – All Cops Are Bastards_ (2012) and _Suburra_ (2015), as well as most of the episodes in the first season of _Gomorra: La serie_ (2014).

Okay, so first things first. _Soldado_ isn't a patch on _Sicario_. Not even close (and, needless to say, there's nothing here to come anywhere near _that_ dinner table scene). And there are some problems which were largely absent first time around. For example, the narrative suffers slightly from the absence of Macer, not insofar as she herself is irreplaceable, but more in the sense that the audience no longer has a surrogate. Because we know who Graver and Gillick really are this time around, there is obviously no point in the film playing its cards close to its chest, and so it adapts a more balls-to-the-wall, damn-the-torpedoes approach. This renders the narrative more morally simplistic than the first film. In tandem with this, perhaps wisely, Sheridan has written _Soldado_ as a more conventional action-thriller than _Sicario_, but this has the knock-on effect that when the bullets start flying, as they do on several occasions, all the political/moral back-and-forth is made to seem nothing more than the material that gets us from one shootout to the next. Additionally, there's an element of repetition, as Isabel is traded off from one group to the next, and one definitely gets a sense of _déjà vu_, as she becomes a metaphorical cog in the screenwriter's machinery. Also, although Solima's direction is good (with that resume, how could he not get the gritty tone right), it's not as sharp as Villeneuve's. Finally, and this is a small point, the title of the film translates as _Hitman 2: Soldier_ [or _Hitman: Day of the Soldier_ in North America]. This makes not a lick of sense, and instead sounds like a 90s action movie starring Michael Dudikoff.

However, for all that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The script is sharp, relevant (references to a spineless POTUS undermining intelligence operations will be sure to please at least half the audience), gruff, and cool. With the two _Sicario_ films, _Hell or High Water_ (2016), _Wind River_ (2017), and _Yellowstone_ (2018-), Sheridan is fast becoming one of Hollywood's most accomplished writers. The film also stars two of the coolest men on the planet being masculine and suppressing their emotions. Del Toro never so much as even hints at cracking a smile, whilst Brolin has lost some of the sardonic dismissiveness he possessed in the first film, but none of the bluster or self-confidence. All things considered, for a film that never seemed to have any real reason to exist, this is a cracking piece of storytelling, and has me already looking forward to the next instalment.,","corruption,cia,sequel,rescue,shootout,explosion,brutality,violence,drugs,sign languages,cartel,neo-noir,mexican cartel,",86,234,"Stefano Sollima,"

That is my only way of explaining why this film is so highly regarded.  I went to the user review area of IMDB just to see if I was missing something or if others thought this good looking, atmospheric, well acted two hour slog sucked as well.  To my relief I found I was not alone.

What we have here is a case of style over substance.  There is really nothing to ""hang your hat on"" with regards to what is happening to the family featured.  When the reveals start coming they are either obvious or trite.  The ending is complete crap, especially after the two hour journey to get to it.

The scariest scene happens early on and is not in any way supernatural.  After, we just go on and on and round and round and can only assume the mother is mentally ill.  That she is imagining everything that is ""odd"" or causing it herself.  When that proves not to be the situation, the denouement we are given is, again, craptastic and straight out of any run of the mill Z grade made for VOD horror movie plot.

This has been compared to ""The Exorcist"" but do not let that fool you.  This is no ""Exorcist"" or even anything close.

At best this is a film about a family dealing with mental illness.  Only not!,While psychological horror movies seem to be a thing of the past, with movies of this nature cropping up once every little while, _Hereditary_ creeps along with the force of looming evil. This isn't an average Halloween, popcorn-at-the-theatre moviegoing experience. Instead, what we are presented with is palpable heaviness for the better half of two hours while tensions rise in a dwindling household and with some burgeoning Satanic undertones encapsulated in some of the darkest, most isolating atmosphere that contends with the likes of _The Witch_ and _Rosemary's Baby_.

Toni Collette plays Annie Graham, mother of two children - eldest son in high school, the youngest a girl possibly at the tail-end of middle school. With the recent death of her mother, Annie attempts again and again to reconcile with the misfortunes - to put it lightly - that befalls her family. Annie's psychological state dances between the forefront of the film, while the backdrop of lingering family turmoil boils to the top.

This is an unrelenting experiment in acceptance, both placed on the key figures in the film, as well as those watching. When watching, keep in mind the word ""control"" and discern whether Annie had any at all. This isn't a movie for anybody - I'd go far as to say that this movie isn't for the average moviegoer. There are certain plot points that don't make sense. But if you go into this knowing what the director was trying to do, which, in my opinion, was to make the viewer feel completely uncomfortable while paying homage to some great horror movies, then it will be a rewarding watch.,Simple Simon met the Pieman playing with a knife.

- ""_Ars Goetia_"", in _Clavicula Salomonis Regis_ [_Lesser Key of Solomon_] (17th century)

When her secretive mother dies, miniatures artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette), is almost relieved, as the two had a deeply fraught relationship. With two children, 16-year-old Peter (Alex Wolff) and 13-year-old Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and a loving husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), Annie is determined to do a better job of raising a family than she felt her mother did. However, when she suffers another, far more devastating loss, Annie's mental state becomes increasingly precarious, as a series of terrifying revelations about her ancestry are slowly revealed.

Hereditary is writer/director Ari Aster's debut feature. However, what's worth noting is that the film is produced by Lars Knudsen, who also produced _The VVitch: A New England Folktale_ (2015). This is significant insofar as _Hereditary_ bears more than a passing resemblance to Robert Eggers's film. Mood, tone, theme, pacing, narrative structure, shot composition; all recall _The VVitch_ at times. Even the plot shares some important beats, most evident in the last shot, which is both narratively and compositionally identical to the shot in _The VVitch_ when Black Phillip speaks for the first time - a BCU on a possessed character as a disciple speaks off camera. And like _The VVitch_, you either go with the plot and let it burrow under your skin, or you remain detached and most likely find the whole enterprise unintentionally hilarious.

In a more generalised sense, there is quite a bit to praise here. For a start, to say the film is a horror is to basically give away the last 20 minutes, as up until that point it's a superbly realised semi-realist study of the crippling psychological disintegration that can accompany bereavement. Speaking of giving things away, very unusually for a Hollywood film, _Hereditary_'s trailer brilliantly misdirects the audience, making it seem as if the film revolves around the death of Annie's mother, when in actual fact, this plot strand is abandoned at the end of the first act, after which the death of Charlie becomes the central focus.

One thing the film does especially well is reward viewers who are paying attention. There are multiple hints and signs throughout of what is going to happen in the last act, and one especially well structured reward involves by far the creepiest moment in the film; the blond man standing in the shadows of the doorway, barely visible, smiling manically at Peter. This is actually the second time we see the character; he is also at the wake early in the movie, watching Charlie approaching the coffin, and, again, smiling unnaturally. This can be easily missed if you're not paying attention, and it's an extremely well realised pseudo-Easter egg. Also worthy of praise is Toni Collette, who gives a superb performance that partly recalls Shelley Duvall's hysterics in Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_ (1980). Collette's ability to communicate everything in her psyche by simply changing her facial expression is outstanding, and somewhat reminiscent of that extraordinary piece of wordless acting by Halle Berry in the last scene of Marc Foster's _Monster's Ball_ (2001). This is especially noticeably towards the end of the film, when Annie is alternating between being herself and being controlled by Paimon; Collette's mastery of her own facial expression tells the audience everything it needs to know about what is happening.

Joshua Rothkopf, in his review of the film for _Time Out_ calls it ""_a new generation's_ Exorcist."" That's a bit over the top; it won't have half the same kind of societal impact as William Friedkin's film did, and it's nowhere near as good as the best horror film of the last few decades, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999). However, it's very well made, is creepy as hell, dares to put real grief on screen, and features excellent performances (and, thankfully, only a couple of jump scares).

Remember ‘Ex Machina’? The simple concept of questioning the state of existence between humanity and artificial intelligence. Whether a sentient entity can reach transcendence or remain restrained within the limitations of their code. How about ‘Her’? Injecting emotional resonance to the artificial intelligence by making them sound and feel almost human. Two stellar features that illustrate the experimentation of AI capabilities. Then comes Netflix’ exclusive Tau. A streetwise woman kidnapped and secluded as a test subject for a scientist who is researching the human mind in order to produce AI.

A cross between an Escape Room game, any kidnapping crime thriller and conscientious existentialism. The problem with this interpretation of said intellectual code, is it’s boring. Vehemently dull to the point where you are wanting something to take you by surprise. Wishing for some sort of twist to smack you across the face with robotic hands. It’s by-the-number narratively speaking. Woman is kidnapped, woman must try to escape the clutches of Skrein’s mundanely miscasted scientist, where woman then befriends a wall by reading poetry and listening to classical music. What’s on this wall you may ask? A triangle.

Much like ‘Oblivion’, this three-sided geometric shape is now associated with sentience. Relating to the Illuminati perhaps? Regardless, does not matter. For the vast majority of the second and third act, Monroe’s gloriously wasted talents were used to humanise this floating triangle, which for all intents and purposes, actually works in conjuring an emotional connection. Then, before the shoddily explosive conclusion that diminished the semi-intellectual approach beforehand, Pyramid Head has code randomly removed (because that’s how computing works...) and so all characterisation that was meticulously built up for the past forty minutes, dissolved into nothingness. Poof! Gone!

Tau, the actual name of the musically-inclined triangle, was the only “character” to have significant development. Even when it attempts to question humanity and what it means to be a “person” in the most basic form available. Monroe’s expositional memory flashbacks? Nope. Skrein’s constant moping around? Nah. So to essentially erase Tau’s character was frustrating more than anything. It made the entire conclusion worthless and one-dimensional. The visual effects and overall production were decent considering the small budget, replicating modernised architecture exquisitely. Which further infuriates me due to the lack of care that went into the plot, characters and inconsiderate pacing. Cold as code!

Admittedly I did nearly fall asleep due to the repetitious nature of the narrative, mostly consisting of Skrein failing to meet a deadline whilst Monroe begs Mr. Triangle to let her escape willingly. So I guess if you’re having trouble sleeping, and you desire a quick remedy, stick on Tau.,","artificial intelligence,kidnapping,escape attempt,",12,26,"Federico D'Alessandro,"

Amidst this setting, the Hotel Artemis is open for business.. The Artemis is not your typical hotel as it provides emergency medical services to members who engage in criminal activities.

The Nurse (Jodie Foster) runs the facility and with the help of her massive Orderly Everest (Dave Bautista), they ensure that only members get admitted and follow the rules as well as receive state of the art care while in the facility.
 Guests at the facility are giving names based on the suite in which they are assigned which involve geographical locales and there are a very strict set of rules they must follow such as no guns, bombs, killing other guests, and so on.
The Hotel Artemis is not a simple stitch and bandage facility as they offer advanced medical services such as Nanites, replacement organ printing, robotic A.I. medical treatment and other services which in 2018 seem like Science Fiction.
Enter Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown), who has tried to leave his criminal past behind him yet was savvy enough to keep paying his membership fees at the Artemis all the while. He and his brother have been injured in a heist and with the city under a deadly riot, they make their way to the Artemis to get treatment and hide out from the chaos outside.

Thanks to their services, the hotel is rarely empty and an Arms Dealer named Acapulco (Charlie Day), and an assassin named Nice (Sofia Boutella), are also in residence. The fact that Nice and Waikiki have a past association makes things a bit interesting as guests are always mindful of those around them even though the strict rules of membership exist to ward off any threats or danger to the guests or staff.
Complications arise when the near capacity hotel is informed that the Wolf King of L.A. (Jeff Goldblum) is en- route. The Nurse opts to follow the rules of first come first served and in doing so enrages his son (Zachary Quinto), who decided to barricade the Hotel to make sure nobody gets in before his father, who incidentally owns the facility.

As if this was not enough of a complication, a police officer from troubled past of The Nurse arrives begging for help which sets a very dangerous chain of events into motion.

The film is a very fresh and entertaining story filled with interesting characters, strong performances, and just enough action to keep the film moving along but yet keeping the focus as a character based drama.

First time Director Drew Pearce gets the most of his cast and has used his script to create a very entertaining and unique film that is well worth a watch. It is so nice to see Jodie Foster showing us once again that she is one of the most gifted actresses of our time as the two-time Oscar winner goes all in to portray a very damaged and troubled character who for what she lacks in glamour; more than makes up for with a determined strength.

I hope this film is a success as I would love to see more stories from the Hotel as I really enjoyed the film from start to finish.

4 stars out of 5,Aaaah near-future Los Angeles, will you ever be portrayed as anything other than a crime-ridden, riotous hellscape? Probably not. And honestly, I'm pretty okay with that. Either way, despite that being the exact setting of _Hotel Artemis_, it has surprisingly little impact on the tale, which takes place almost entirely within the titular hotel. It's good, and everyone is good in it, plus you've got the #aesthetic to take into account, which all in all is more than enough for me.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,**_Aesthetically pleasing, but the narrative is predictable and clichéd_**

I really wanted this thing where all the way through_ _the film, we are led to believe by the media in the movie and by the way some of the characters talk about it, that we're safe in here in the place that we pay for, and the trouble is this kind of faceless, multi ethnic mob on the outside, and that actually we always think the problem is on the outside, but really, the problem is on the inside.

- Drew Pearce; ""_Hotel Artemis_ Director Drew Pearce on Making His Personal Genre Movie, His Influences, and More"" (Jack Giroux); _Slash Film_ (June 7, 2018)

_Hotel Artemis_ is a film which doesn't do a great deal wrong. However, it is also a film which doesn't do a great deal right. It just kind of hangs in mid-air, with clichéd characters acting in clichéd ways and having clichéd conversations. And then it ends. It's not actually _about_ anything. It's also predictable, with precious little substance. It looks pretty though.

In 2028, riots are tearing Los Angeles apart. The film takes place primarily in the eponymous Hotel Artemis, a secret hospital for criminals in the heart of the city. The motley crew of characters, many of whom are known only by the name of the room in which they're staying, include Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown) and his brother Honolulu (Brian Tyree Henry), bank robbers who have been involved in a shootout with police; Nice (Sofia Boutella), an assassin who ""_only kills important people_"", and just so happens to be Waikiki's ex-girlfriend; and Acapulco (a spectacularly miscast Charlie Day), a weapons dealer and all round weasel. Also present are The Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum), Los Angeles's most feared gangster, who also finances the hospital, his incompetent son, Crosby (an underutilised Zachery Quinto), and Morgan (Jenny Slate), a cop injured in the riots. The hospital is run by ""Nurse"" (Jodie Foster), an agoraphobic alcoholic haunted by visions of her past, with porter duties handled by Everest (Dave Bautista). The hospital functions because all guests must adhere to a rigid set of rules (the first of which is ""_don't kill the other patients_"") and a strict no weapons policy.

Sounds pretty interesting doesn't it? It's not. The dialogue is awful, the narrative beats can be seen coming a mile away, and the characters are all archetypes, with only Nurse really fleshed out to any degree. There's the loud-mouth snivelling weapons dealer, the gorgeous but oh-so-deadly assassin, the criminal kingpin and his screw-up son who just wants to be like dad, the skilled bank robber who spends most of his time trying to get himself out of the trouble caused by his unreliable brother, and the tough-as-old-boots medical professional who just wants to help people when in actual fact, she's beyond help herself. The premise may be reasonably interesting, but, in his debut feature, writer/director Drew Pearce undermines it by populating the _milieu_ with cardboard cut-outs instead of characters. True, most of the actors give it their all (Bautista in particular gives a performance far superior to the material with which he has to work), but there's just no substance here, no depth. There are simply too many clichés at every level to be able to overlook them.

Yes, it's an original(ish) idea made with a small(ish) budget, which is exactly what we need more of these days, when every second film is a CGI-infested remake, comic book adaptation, or sequel (or a CGI-infested remake of a sequel to a comic book adaptation). However, an original idea is all very well and good, but it can only take you so far; the execution has to be there as well, and this is where _Hotel Artemis_ falls down. It's simply not an especially well-made film. Pearce does a reasonably good job with the directorial side of things, as aesthetically, the hotel is really intriguing, with a nice use of primary colours and a well-conceived juxtaposition of modern technology and 3D printers with retro décor and secret passages. In terms of plot, however, there's just nothing to latch onto or get your teeth into. None of the characters really do or say anything very interesting, and a half-hour into the film, as it became increasingly apparent that none of them were going to be developed to any great degree, I just stopped caring.,","nurse,hotel,orderly,dystopia,street riots,riot police,near future,clandestine hospital,",50,61,"Drew Pearce,"

Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind._

- Ralph Waldo Emerson; ""Self-Reliance"" (1841)

In _Walden_, his 1854 memoir/philosophical treatise, Henry David Thoreau chronicles a period of two years, two months, and two days during which time he lived alone in a small cabin he himself had built in the forest near Walden Pond, Massachusetts, on property owned by his mentor and friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Inspired by the tenets of transcendentalism, of especial importance to Thoreau was ""Self-Reliance"", an 1841 essay by Emerson, which argues that an individual must avoid conformity, follow their own ideas and concepts, and trust in their own instincts if they are to attain a deeper understanding of the nature of existence. In _Walden_, Thoreau was putting this concept to the test, isolating himself from civil society, and existing in nature with only the barest means of subsistence;

> _I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach._

_Walden_ went on to become one of the (many) foundational texts of libertarianism, the core principles of which are the valuation of personal liberty above all else, and the encouragement of scepticism towards authority in general, and the state/government in particular.

All of which brings us to _Leave no Trace_, which could, perhaps, be described as a darker version of Matt Ross's _Captain Fantastic_ (2016). Directed by Debra Granik (_Winter's Bone_), and written for the screen by Granik and Anne Rosellini, based on Peter Rock's 2010 novel, _My Abandonment_, the film tells the story of Will (Ben Foster), a veteran suffering from PTSD, who is living off the grid with his daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie). Making their home in a national park in Portland, Oregon, they embody many of the concepts underpinning Emerson's notions of self-reliance; individual authority, nonconformity, solitude, internal self-truth, with Will especially valuing freedom of thought. However, when a jogger sees Tom, park wardens are dispatched to track them down, and social services open an investigation into their situation. Will is aghast, resenting the infringement upon his autonomy, recalling Iain King's statement that

> _autonomy should only be infringed if a person is unable to know their own interests on a particular matter._

This certainly isn't the case with Will, and he sees no reason why he and Tom shouldn't be allowed to continue to live in their own way.

None of the philosophical theories outlined above are explicitly mentioned anywhere in the film. However, knowledge of them definitely helps one to more easily understand Will. Whether Granik or Rosellini are even aware of these concepts is beside the point, as they serve to give one a more assured theoretical entry point into a not easily penetrated film. For example, does one have to know that Will is at stage six of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development to understand or enjoy the film? No, of course not. Does it help? Absolutely.

On a less theoretical note, the film does a lot that on paper would seem to be wrong; for long stretches of time, there is no real sense of any kind of standard Aristotelian conflict, as we simply observe Will and Tom going about their day. In tandem with this, the film is extremely light on plot, incident, and tangible character development, focusing instead on mood and tone, and calling upon the actors to externalise their emotions through action and expression rather than dialogue. Obviously, this means almost everything hinges on the quality of the performances and the believability of the bond between the characters. Thankfully, both Foster and McKenzie are exceptional – he plays Will as someone who has seen the darker side of humanity and has no time for frivolousness, whereas she plays Tom as someone desperate to have a childhood, but who also wants to make her father proud. In one particularly telling scene, when they must leave on a moment's notice, he tells her to pack only what is essential, and she places a toy horse in her backpack, but only after she has wrapped it up so Will can't see it, an action which tells us a great deal about both characters.

The film's pacing is both its greatest asset and its biggest flaw. To speed things up would have compromised the tone Granik is going for. However, this kind of methodical pacing is likely to alienate a lot of viewers, who will undoubtedly criticise the film as boring, and its focus on Will and Tom to the exclusion of almost everything else as too narrow. When it does branch out (for example, a minor sub-theme is the treatment of veterans upon their return to society), it is only insofar as to show how the two main characters are affected. What's especially interesting about the story, however, is that the narrative seems predicated on the transcendentalist notion of the inherent goodness of people; pretty much everyone Will and Tom encounter is trying to do right by them, even the social workers are genuinely trying to help them. In the end, what the film gives us is a deeply respectful portraiture of a man trying to make the best of it in the only way he knows how.

- Paweł Pawlikowski; """"I wanted to make it a beautiful disaster"": Paweł Pawlikowski on his new film _Cold War_"" (Alissa Wilkinson); _Vox_ (December 21, 2018)

Reading around some of the reviews of _Zimna wojna_ [_Cold War_], I recognise that this should have been a film I liked, loved even, as so much of what these critics are praising are exactly the kinds of things I myself often look for in a film, and I genuinely wish I had been able to get what people like _The Guardian_'s Peter Bradshaw or the _Los Angeles Times_'s Justin Cheng have gotten from it. It's one of the best-reviewed films of the year (94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing), and I freely acknowledge there's a huge amount to praise here, with elements of the visual design borderline genius. However, all the aesthetic brilliance in the world doesn't hide what, for me, is its single greatest flaw - it just left me utterly cold; I didn't care about the two main characters, and I didn't buy their relationship. Yes, I'm aware that emotional detachment is exactly what it was going for, and it's probably unfair to criticise a film for successfully doing what it intended to do, but when it ended, all I could think was ""meh."" Now, I know what you're thinking, because I've thought it myself in relation to any number of user reviews for any number of films – you're probably already formulating your ""_go back to Michael Bay_"" comments, and I can't say I blame you. But, whilst I can certainly appreciate much of what is on offer, and understand why critics have loved it, the end result for me was one of indifference. Although, to be fair, that may say more about myself than the film.

Written by Paweł Pawlikowski (_My Summer of Love_; _The Woman in the Fifth_; _Ida_), Janusz Głowacki (_Wałęsa. Człowiek z nadziei_), and Piotr Borkowski (_Lek wysokosci_), and directed by Pawlikowski, who loosely based the story on events in his parents' lives, to whom the film is also dedicated, the plot of Zimna wojna is simplicity itself. The film begins in 1949, two years since a communist government came to power and the country was provisionally renamed _Rzeczpospolita ludowa_ [Polish People's Republic]. It opens with composer and pianist Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), his ethnomusicologist producer Irena (Agata Kulesza), and rigid state-sponsored overseer Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc) travelling through the isolated rural communities of the Polish countryside, recording folk songs and attempting to find recruits for a folk music school, with the aim of putting together an ensemble to perform nationally, and hopefully, internationally. Wiktor is bored out of his mind with the repetitive nature of the work, until a young woman named Zula (an extraordinary Joanna Kulig) comes to the school to audition. Although she doesn't fit the profile of what they are looking for – she's from the city rather than the countryside, is rumoured to have spent time in prison for killing her father, and performs not a folk song at her audition, but a piece from a Soviet film – and although Irena points out there are better singers, Wiktor argues that she has ""_something different_."" Irena, who may or may not be in love with Wiktor, immediately recognises that he's enamoured with Zula, but he assures her he's acting out of pure professionalism. Of course, he isn't, and soon enough, he and Zula are in the midst of a passionate relationship. And that's pretty much it as far as the plot goes. The rest of the film takes place over 20 years and four countries (Poland, France, Yugoslavia, and East Germany), but it never branches out from the central relationship. There are no subplots or significant supporting characters; the narrative is pared down to within an inch of its life, with every scene, every line of dialogue, every action, existing only in relation to this focal driving force.

So, to look first at some aspects of the film which I liked. The aesthetic is absolutely unparalleled, as Pawlikowski and director of photography Łukasz Żal (_Ida_; _Loving Vincent_) allow the visual design to both originate from and convey thematic points, a truly extraordinary example of form and content blending into one another. As an example, the film is exquisitely shot in Academy ratio (1.37:1), which has the effect of confining the characters within the frame. The nature of the film lends itself to sweeping vistas and cityscapes captured in anamorphic (2.39:1), but, instead, Pawlikowski and Żal use the box-like nature of the Academy frame to trap the characters, meaning they don't seem free even when standing in the vast open countryside or in Paris at night. The epic nature of the narrative and the confined frame work in a kind of ironic symbiosis to visually convey the important theme of the tensions within and between the characters; freedom and confinement constantly working against one another.

Another example of the synergy between form and content is the use of focus. For example, in the opening scene, the shallow focus creates a depth of field so small that the village just behind the in-focus singers is completely flattened. This renders it visually inaccessible, and thus compels the audience to concentrate fully on nothing except the foreground singers. Compare this with the scene where Kaczmarek is giving a speech extolling the glory of the state and the prestige of the school to a collection of bored students, all the while a cow is wandering around in the mud behind him. The use of a deeper focus here than in the opening means that the cow falls within the larger depth of field, and can be clearly seen, once again directing the audience's attention, only this time that attention is directed away from the foreground character as opposed towards him. The cow, obviously enough, serves as a commentary, telling us exactly what Pawlikowski thinks of Kaczmarek's speech, and the ideologies underpinning it.

Another scene of this ilk is when a worker is attempting to hang a ""_We welcome tomorrow_"" banner on the front of the music school, under directions from Kaczmarek. However, falling from his ladder (and by the sounds of it, falling to his death), the banner is never hung, hanging limply across one side of the building. Again, as with the cow, this is Pawlikowski criticising the state-sanctioned machinery introduced by the _Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza_ [Polish United Workers' Party] since 1948. Of course, the communists are not ""welcoming tomorrow"" – they are far more interested in the past, which is why they are collecting folk songs; in an effort to create a Politburo-approved musical tradition designed to instil both national pride and political conformity, by rejecting the ""western"" rock & roll music of tomorrow in favour of a musical past.

Speaking of music, in relation to the way the opening scene is shot, it instantly becomes clear how vital a part of the story music and singing are. As the narrative develops, music becomes Wiktor and Zula's everything – they derive hope from it, they imbue it with their feelings, it brings them together, it drives them apart, it even comes to symbolise the strange bond between them, never moreso than when Wiktor refers to an album on which they have been collaborating as ""_our child_.""

Another structural aspect that is exceptionally well handled is how Pawlikowski designs the time jumps, as the film skips forward to the next instalment in the story. When a sequence is finished, the film cuts to black, and then, using a variation of a J cut, the sound from the next scene can be heard a few seconds prior to the image being seen. Furthermore, that sound is usually music, reemphasising just how important music is to these characters. Interestingly however, the last few time jumps don't use music to introduce the incoming scene, perhaps referring to the changes in the characters' circumstances at this stage of the film, the darker ideological underpinnings of their psyches. In relation to this, it's also worth pointing out that once we get to the second half of the film, the two leads almost never smile (not that they smiled that much in the first half). Ironically enough, the character who smiles the most is probably Kaczmarek.

So, having spent all this time waxing lyrical about aspects of the film which impressed me, why did I not enjoy it? As I said above, there's a huge amount to admire here, the craft is exceptional, but, at the end of the day, this is a romance. And it doesn't work as a romance. Yes, it's not what you would call a standard romance by any means, the character motivations and justifications that you'd see in other narratives of this ilk (not just filmic texts) are absent here, and maybe because of that, although there was undeniable chemistry between the leads, I just didn't buy their seemingly insatiable compulsion to seek one another out, sleep together, hurt one another, and then split up. The problem is, this exact template happens about five times – they meet, have a great time for a while, argue over something, and one runs off. Wash, rinse, repeat. And even at only 85 minutes, this kind of structural repetition becomes, well, repetitive, as I increasingly found myself asking ""why are these two even together?""

To give you an example of what I'm talking about, during one particular argument, after Zula finds out Wiktor has been lying to people about her background, he explains, ""_I wanted to give you more colour_"". Seriously? These are two people who have precious little respect for one another; beneath all the eroticism and physical attraction, they are simply two irreparably damaged people trying to save one another, living with a co-dependency, but instead hastening each other towards destruction. And as I couldn't buy into the believability of the romance, the entire enterprise floundered; it never achieves the status it seems to be aiming for, that of cathartic high-tragedy. And although the end is very well done, and the last line is spectacular, it left me unmoved, because, by that stage, I just didn't care. True, the structure of the film and the insanely tight editing means that events in their lives are glanced at rather than lingered over, so the kind of nuances and character beats you'd often expect are absent, with the audience being allocated no time to become enveloped by the emotions on screen. As the narrative is built on ellipses and omissions, many (in fact, almost all) of the standard romantic tropes simply aren't present. By design, the film is barren and emotionally impenetrable, and in that sense, Pawlikowski seems to have been attempting to construct as detached a narrative as he possibly could. If anything, he succeeds too well.,","paris, france,berlin, germany,cold war,love,tragic love,1950s,1960s,",12,19,"Paweł Pawlikowski,"

If it appears that the movie concerns itself with a flimsy predicament enhanced by arguably shallow pop culture aspects then that's because it's precisely what a significant proportion of the male population, like the main character,(played by Andrew Garfield who is superb too) preoccupy themselves with.

>_Also I loved it because it was quite skewering of Hollywood and a kind of patriarchal abusive system. I think Sam sees himself as a Travis Bickle. He sees himself as this liberator, he's fully deluded in this self-assessment. He sees himself as this vigilante liberator of the divine, sacred feminine in Hollywood. But actually he has a tendency to perpetuate the same abuse in an unconscious way perhaps. I just found it really, really interesting, and it's a mystery, within a mystery, within a mystery, and there's no getting to the centre of it. I think that's maybe the point - we're on a constant quest towards the centre of things. And perhaps that's enough, just being on the quest is enough._

In 2001, an unknown 26-year-old filmmaker named Richard Kelly released a film called _Donnie Darko_. Filmed on a tight budget over a few weeks, it made little impact at the box-office, but was critically championed as heralding a genuinely unique and exciting voice in genre filmmaking. The following year, the film was released on VHS and DVD, earning twice as much as it did at the cinema, and giving Kelly virtual _carte blanche_ for his next project. In 2006, that hotly-anticipated project was premièred in a rough-cut form at Cannes. The 160-minute _Southland Tales_ was savaged by critics, and went through multiple re-edits before a 144-minute version was released theatrically in North America in 2007. Grossing less than $1 million against a $7 million budget, the film was released straight-to-DVD in most international territories. Kelly's career has yet to recover, and he has made only one film since. In 2014, David Robert Mitchell released his second feature, _It Follows_, which he shot on a tight budget over a few weeks. A box office and critical success, the film was championed as heralding a genuinely unique and exciting voice in genre filmmaking, giving Mitchell virtual _carte blanche_ for his next project. In 2018, that hotly-anticipated project was premièred at Cannes, where it was savaged by critics.

Okay, the analogy isn't perfect – _Southland Tales_ was Kelly's second film, whereas _Under the Silver Lake_ is Mitchell's third; _It Follows_ was nowhere near as good or as celebrated as _Donnie Darko_; and _Under the Silver Lake_ isn't quite as bad as _Southland Tales_, nor have the negative reviews from Cannes been quite as damning or universal. However, the sequence of events is undeniably similar - a young filmmaker riding high on an unexpected success dusts off an ambitious older project he had been unable to make at the time, and is given far too much autonomy and leeway, resulting in a pretentious, self-indulgent, convoluted, overlong mess. It's like no one has learnt from the hubris of Michael Cimino!

Positioning itself as equal parts neo-noir and genre subversion, _Under the Silver Lake_ is essentially a cross between David Lynch's _Mulholland Drive_ (2001) and Thomas Pynchon's _Inherent Vice_ (2009). With the major difference being that it's absolutely, unrelentingly terrible. As with Mitchell's previous films, _Silver Lake_ works as both an example and a subversion of genre - _The Myth of the American Sleepover_ (2010) was a homage to films such as Peter Bogdanovich's _The Last Picture Show_ (1971), George Lucas's _American Graffiti_ (1973) and the work of John Hughes, whilst also deconstructing the coming-of-age subgenre; and _It Follows_ recalls films such as William Friedkin's _The Exorcist_ (1973), Wes Craven's _A Nightmare on Elm Street_ (1984) and the work of John Carpenter, whilst also satirising the tropes of such films. _Silver Lake_ is no different - a mystery noir à la Robert Aldrich's _Kiss Me Deadly_ (1955), Robert Altman's _The Long Goodbye_ (1973), and Roman Polański's _Chinatown_ (1974), the film is also at pains to undermine and critique many of the generic markers found in such films. A 140-minute labyrinthine, paranoia-laden shaggy-dog story full of MacGuffins, false leads, narrative dead ends, and unexplained details, the film relocates the detective stories of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett to the chaotic postmodern era of cognitive semiotics where the relationship between signifier and signified is now so arbitrary that meaning-making itself has become a protean commodity. However, it is easily the most self-important piece of garbage I've seen in a long time; a philosophically juvenile rumination thoroughly convinced of its own portentousness. Fundamentally misogynistic (it's not misogyny, apparently, because Mitchell is being super-ironic when he presents no less than six female characters as literal sex toys for the protagonist), it's at least 45 minutes too long, with an unfocused narrative, poorly thought-out metaphors, an insipid protagonist, about 377 themes, and a laughable screenplay. The cinematography is pretty though.

Set in contemporary LA, _Under the Silver Lake_ follows Sam (Andrew Garfield), a 33-year-old man-child with no job, no ambition, and no direction, whose day consists of sitting on his balcony watching his neighbour (Wendy Vanden Heuvel) parade around topless, having unfulfilling NSA sex with a friend-with-benefits (Riki Lindhome), and visiting his drinking buddy (Topher Grace) to use a drone to spy on women (it should tell you a bunch about the film that none of these three characters are even assigned a name). Out of the blue, he meets and instantly falls in love with Sarah (an admittedly radiant Riley Keough), but when he visits her apartment the day after meeting her, he finds her gone and the apartment empty, apart from a shoebox with a photograph and a few trinkets, and a strange symbol painted on the wall. Although he later identifies Sarah as one of three women killed in a car crash alongside billionaire media mogul (and professional stuntman) Jefferson Sevence (Chris Gann), having recognised a hat found at the scene to be hers, he refuses to believe she's dead. And so begins an odyssey to track her down that ultimately involves, amongst other things, a parrot who keeps repeating the same meaningless phrase, a hipster pirate, secret codes hidden in everyday objects such as statues, song lyrics, _Nintendo Power_ magazines, and cereal boxes, a glam rock band named Jesus and the Brides of Dracula, the July 1970 issue of _Playboy_, a dog murderer, a conspiracy theorist comic book writer (Patrick Fischler), the Hobo Code, a vast network of underground tunnels, an actual literal homeless king (David Yow), a helpful coyote, an unhelpful skunk, an escort agency staffed by former child-stars, a balloon dancer (Grace Van Patten), a walled-off Xanadu-like mansion, a mysterious songwriter (Jeremy Bobb) with a strange claim, a female serial killer who enters men's apartments wearing nothing but an owl mask, and a New Age cult lead by super-wealthy men.

And if this makes it sound convoluted, unwieldly, and overly plotted, believe me, you don't know the half of it.

Perhaps the most immediately obvious aspects of _Silver Lake_ is the sheer range of homages that Mitchell includes at both plot and formal levels. Some of these homages are impressively handled, some not so much. The music by Rich Vreeland, for example, and the cinematography by Mike Gioulakis are both extremely retro, serving to situate the film firmly in the formal styles of yesterday. Vreeland's score (although I didn't like it in and of itself) is a solid imitation of the work of composers such as Franz Waxman (_Sunset Boulevard_; _A Place in the Sun_; _Rear Window_) and Bernard Herrmann (_Citizen Kane_; _Vertigo_; _Psycho_), whilst Gioulakis's photography, with its overly dramatic camera movements and crash zooms that seem to come out of nowhere, recalls the work of Robert Burks (_Rear Window_; _To Catch a Thief_; _Vertigo_) and Sam Leavitt (_The Defiant Ones_; _Anatomy of a Murder_; _Cape Fear_).

Most of the other homages come at plot level, and although some are well integrated into the narrative, many feel shoehorned in, as if Mitchell is showing off his range of reference, so much so that the film essentially becomes pastiche. Examples include Sam's mother's obsession with Janet Gaynor, particularly Frank Borzage's _7th Heaven_ (1927); Sam sitting on his balcony using binoculars to spy on people, á la L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) in Alfred Hitchcock's _Rear Window_ (1954); Sam's fascination with Don Ornitz's picture of Janet Wolf from the cover of the July 1970 issue of _Playboy_; a Nirvana poster above Sam's bed; Sam and Sarah watching Jean Negulesco's _How to Marry a Millionaire_ (1953); a brief glimpse of an _Amazing Spider-Man_ comic (intertextual and self-reflexive, given Garfield's appearance as the titular character in two films); a visual quotation of Marilyn Monroe in a swimming pool from George Cukor's unfinished _Something's Got to Give_ (1962); the Brides of Dracula doing a cover of Lulu's ""To Sir with Love"" (1967) from James Clavell's film of the same name; R.E.M.'s ""Strange Currencies"" (1994) playing at a party; a visit to Griffith Observatory from Nicholas Ray's _Rebel Without a Cause_ (1955); references to the original _Legend of Zelda_ (1986); a very on-the-nose shot of a gravestone with the word ""Hitchcock"" on it; and a scene that references songs as varied as The Arrows' ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" (1975), Gary Portnoy's ""Where Everybody Knows Your Name"" (1982) from the TV show _Cheers_, Foreigner's ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" (1984), Harold Faltermeyer's ""Axel F"" (1985) from the film _Beverly Hills Cop_, Pixies' ""Where is my Mind?"" (1988), Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" (1991), and Backstreet Boys' ""I Want it That Way"" (1999). The most consistent referential touchstone, however, is David Lynch, particularly _Mulholland Drive_, an infinitely superior mystery thriller also set in the darker environs of LA involving a sprawling cast of strange characters.

Thematically, the film is all over the place, never settling on any one issue (or even a few issues), instead jumping around like a hyperactive puppy trying to be in eight different places at once. Characters say things such as ""_who isn't being followed these days?_"" and ""_the ideology you thought you adopted through free will was actually subliminal messaging_"", but it's all meaningless in a narrative chaos where nothing is ever examined for more than a couple of minutes before the film leaps onto something new. Positing that pop culture has profound hidden meaning (in direct contrast to most cultural-anthropological thinking), the film is so imprecise and scattered that it's impossible to tell if Mitchell actually buys into the notion that schizophrenic conspiracies are all around us or if he's being facetious.

And yes, I understand what he's doing here - presenting the film from the point of view of a pop culture-saturated Millennial who's easily distracted and hence keeps losing the run of his own story. However, just because it's apparent what the director is trying to do doesn't mean he has succeeded. Oliver Stone did a far better job of depicting a similarly media-soaked shortened-attention span over 20 years ago with _Natural Born Killers_ (1994). Easily the most interesting issue touched on is the concept that much of what has defined generations and been the artistic impetus behind and symbol of cultural revolutions throughout the 20th century all comes from the same corrupted and cynical place; the music that has most embodied rebellion and freedom is actually even more manufactured than the worst boy band could ever be. This is a fascinating and fundamentally postmodernist way of thinking, but mere moments after introducing it, Mitchell abandons the theme entirely in favour of a piece of absolutely gratuitous violence which says nothing of interest about anything.

The most troubling thing about the film from a thematic point of view, however, is how it depicts women. Yes, it's partly about the male gaze and how Hollywood has a track record of objectifying women, especially in films of this nature, so a degree of objectification is necessary. But Mitchell does it to the point where critique simply becomes content - he doesn't need six women (only two of whom are even given names, and none of whom receive much in the way of characterisation) to throw themselves at Sam to adequately deconstruct the trope. Granted, his intentions may be noble; he is obviously side-lining the female characters with the goal of satirising male entitlement, but he is unable to distinguish between replication and repudiation. All the best intentions in the world don't alter the fact that the women in the film are wallpaper, and his attempt to critique Hollywood's tendency to depict women as such ends up as simply another example of the very trope he is setting out to critique. So all the unnecessarily topless shots aren't exploitative you see, because irony!! Additionally, it's worth mentioning that Sam doesn't initiate a single sexual encounter; every one of them is initiated by the woman. How does that fit into Mitchell's deconstruction of Hollywood's depiction of men using women, if the women are essentially allowing themselves to be used? If his critique was in any way consistent, Sam would be seducing them, not the other way around, thus allowing Mitchell to directly engage with the notion that men look at women as playthings. It's a facile attempt to critique a theme that cries out this is a filmmaker attempting something that he simply doesn't have the requisite ability to pull off.

And if only these thematic issues were the film's only problems, it mightn't be so bad. Unfortunately, there is so, so much else wrong here. This is a (supposed) satire, yet there is practically no humour. There are a couple of funny scenes (such as when Sam beats up two children for egging his car), but they are few and far between. Additionally, Mitchell completely fails to make us care about Sam or his quest to find Sarah; there is no emotional connection whatsoever. As for the quest itself, it soon becomes obvious that we're following Sam down a rabbit-hole which Mitchell has filled to the brim with pointless digressions, meaningless distractions, and derivative clichés. Whereas in _Mulholland Drive_, Lynch creates a beautiful and complex tapestry where everything has precise meaning, with no wasted motion, no weirdness simply for weirdness sake, in _Silver Lake_, Mitchell just lobs anything and everything at the viewer whether it's ultimately significant or not. A pirate? Sure. A female serial killer? Why not. A dog murderer? Of course. A story that makes sense and deals with its themes coherently? Don't be ridiculous. It's like the worst type of student film where the filmmaker has been allowed to shoot whatever he wants, and ends up making something so convoluted that any meaning it may have becomes subsumed amongst self-important pretension. And the more needlessly complex and bloated the plot becomes, the less interesting it is. The whole thing smacks of Mitchell shouting ""_look at me. Look how wacky I am._""

_Under the Silver Lake_ is a tiresome, self-important, overlong, intellectually juvenile mess. If Mitchell actually has anything to say about subliminal messaging, the commodification of women, wealth buying privileges even in the afterlife, the pervasiveness of pop culture, or conspiracy theories, it's lost within a painfully dull and self-indulgent plot. With _It Follows_, Mitchell was constricted by a tight budget. With _Silver Lake_, he has been allowed to play relatively unsupervised in the sandbox, and the results are disastrous; a swollen, self-admiring film that can't follow through on anything, thematically or narratively, a film that is totally and completely in love with itself.,","secret society,seduction,surrealism,dark comedy,dream sequence,voyeur,part animation,neo-noir,hollywood hills,subliminal message,",70,59,"David Robert Mitchell,"

- Elyse Schein and Paula Bernstein quoting Bobby Shafran; _Identical Strangers: A Memoir of Twins Separated and Reunited_ (2007)

What is the primary factor in making us who we are? Were the truly great figures of pure evil – Elizabeth Báthory, Adolf Hitler, Harold Shipman, Peter Scully, Adam Sandler – always destined to become who they became, or are there to be found moments and influences in their environment which turned them into the monsters with whom we're familiar? If our destiny is genetically encoded at the moment of our conception, can we really say there is such a thing as human agency? In short, it's the age-old question of nature vs. nurture; does biological determinism supersede free will? Focused on precisely these questions, twin studies involve researching twins to so as to compare and contrast the importance of genetic factors against environmental factors. A branch of behavioural genetics, when most people hear the term ""twin studies"", they probably think of Josef Mengele's sickening experiments in Auschwitz. However, these experiments were inhuman and not even remotely typical of scientifically approved twin studies, which are an accepted, if somewhat controversial, attempt to determine the etiology of differential psychologies in individuals who are genetically similar. And these are the murky waters charted by director Tim Wardle's _Three Identical Strangers_. Covering some of the same ground as Elyse Schein and Paula Bernstein's book, _Identical Strangers: A Memoir of Twins Separated and Reunited_ (2007), and Lori Shinseki's documentary _The Twinning Reaction_ (2017), the film presents a bizarre stranger-than-fiction story, which begins as a light-hearted human-interest piece before taking several darker turns. A big hit at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the US Documentary Special Jury Award for Storytelling, _Strangers_ is hotly tipped for Oscar glory, and has been almost universally well-received by critics (96% approval on Rotten Tomatoes at time of writing). However, for me, although the fascinating central story is undoubtedly gripping, there are just too many egregious problems in the telling, including an excess of distasteful sensationalism; a dearth of contextualising scientific information; overly simplistic ethical, moral, philosophical, and esoteric conclusions; stylistic drabness; and an overreliance on plot twists, which often forces the filmmakers to manipulate the material beyond what you would expect normal of a documentary.

The film begins in 1980, as Bobby Shafran heads for his first day at Sullivan County Community College in New York. However, upon arriving, he is taken aback by how friendly everyone seems, with people acting as if they know him, and welcoming him back. Meanwhile, Bobby is approached by second-year student Michael Domnitz, who had heard that his friend Eddy Gallan had returned to school. Coming to say hi, Domnitz is stunned when he encounters Bobby, who he now sees is identical to Eddy. Learning that Bobby was adopted, and was born on July 12, 1961, Domnitz tells him he has a twin brother. After Bobby and Eddy met, their story is reported nationally, and reading a newspaper article about the twins, David Kellman is stunned by what he sees – he looks exactly like them, he too was adopted, and he too was born on July 12, 1961. The twins were, in fact, triplets. The trio quickly bond, move into an apartment together, and eventually open a restaurant in New York, Triplets Roumanian Steak House. Becoming minor celebrities, they appear on talk shows across the country and have a cameo in Susan Seidelman's _Desperately Seeking Susan_ (1985). However, they and their families are puzzled as to why they had been separated, and why their adoptive parents had not been told they were triplets. Was it a coincidence that Bobby had been placed with an affluent family, Eddy with a middle-class family, and David with a blue-collar family? Did the regular aptitude and psychological tests they received as children, part of what their parents were told was a ""_routine childhood-development study_"", have anything to do with their separation? What was the involvement of one of the country's largest social service agencies, the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services? How much did New York's most preeminent Jewish adoption agency, Louise Wise Services, know? How was Dr. Peter B. Neubauer of the Jewish Board's Child Development Centre in Manhattan involved? How did the triplets' birth mother fit into what happened? As they begin to investigate, they soon stumble upon a series of shocking secrets that would change their lives, and the lives of many others, forever.

_Three Identical Strangers_ starts out as jaunty as you could possibly imagine – Bobby heading off to college as Rainbow's ""Since You Been Gone"" (1978) plays on the radio. Within the first half-hour, the film also features cheerful montages cut to Katrina and the Waves' ""Walking on Sunshine"" (1983) and Kim Wilde's ""Kids in America"" (1981). Ominous this most certainly isn't; with the early parts of the documentary presented as if this were a feel-good story no different from any you might see on daytime TV shows such as _The Phil Donahue Show_ or _The Oprah Winfrey Show_. This makes sense, given how much time the triplets spent on such TV shows. Indeed, so laidback are these early scenes that the whole thing could easily be the opening episode of a sitcom about three likeable guys accidentally learning they're brothers and going on a madcap adventure together.

Another noticeable structural element concerns what Wardle and editor Michael Harte referred to at a Q&A after a screening in Dublin as a ""_past tense_"" and a ""_present tense_"". The past tense section covers roughly the first half of the film, running up to the end of the first round of interviews, which were conducted from 2011-2015. The present tense section then picks up in 2016. The transition between the two is pretty obvious, but it's worth mentioning as it's not something you usually see in a documentary. Half-way through the film, Wardle thanks Bobby and David, who are being interviewed separately, and they say goodbye, get up, and leave the room. It's very unusual to see a documentary film drawing attention to its own artifice in this manner – the furthest most will go will be to include the interviewer's voice, but even that is relatively rare. By featuring a scene like this, especially so early in the film, Wardle and Harte are alerting the audience to the fact that something has changed, and from here on out, things are going to be in a different register; their use of tenses to describe this shift is as accurate a description as you're going to get, almost as if we've moved from pre-recorded material to live footage.

It soon becomes apparent that the second half of the film is much less focused on narrative than the first, whereas the first is relatively light in the way of moral, ethical, or philosophical musing. The second, in contrast, becomes increasingly esoteric as the brothers struggle to find out the ""why"" of what happened to them. Both halves feature a mixture of talking heads, archival footage, and reconstructions, but almost all of the reconstruction material and most of the archival footage is confined to the first half, which is a good indication as to the different contents, and all in all, it's a well-managed structural technique.

One such technique, however, which doesn't work is Wardle and Harte's decision to repeat certain footage at key moments in the film. So, for example, when an important bit of information is revealed in the present, there are ""flashbacks"" to the relevant moment(s) in the past whose meaning has been altered due to the new contextualisation – think Bryan Singer's _The Usual Suspects_ (1995) or Christopher Nolan's _Memento_ (2000). The problem with this is two-fold; a) the technique is used far, far too often; and, b) it's sensationalist and manipulative. In a fiction film, this kind of thing can work both aesthetically and thematically, because fictional narratives are focalised, told from either a singular or multiple points-of-view. Within this context, repeating previously seen footage can work very well. Documentaries are not focalised (or they shouldn't be), and as we once again hear dialogue we heard sometimes only 15 minutes previously, the technique (which is not even done in an especially artistic manner) cheapens the whole process, as if the director is literally appearing on screen to remind us not only of why such and such a piece of information is important, but of how it should re-shape our perception of previous events. This goes beyond hand-holding, and into brow-beating.

And with what is this brow-beating concerned? The film really has two major themes; morality/ethics and nature vs. nurture. In terms of morality, at the Dublin Q&A, Wardle referred to the scientists behind splitting the triplets up as succumbing to ""noble cause corruption"", arguing that they probably set out to accomplish something laudable, but were not above using unethical means to do so. That Neubauer, in particular, could allow this to happen is especially ironic, given the obvious touchstone of Nazi experimentation with Jewish prisoners, and his background as an Austrian Jew who had fled the Holocaust. It does, however, seem strange that when examining the morality of what was done to the brothers, Wardle makes no mention of David Reimer, a male who was reassigned as a girl in 1965 when he was only a few months old and raised female, based upon dishonest advice given to his parents by psychologist John Money, who was attempting to prove that gender identity is learned. As there are a lot of parallels between the brothers' stories and Reimer's, and between Neubauer and Money, including a reference or two would have helped contextualise things.

As to the question of nature vs. nurture, initially, events seem to point very much to nature – the brothers all smoked the same brand of cigarettes; they had all been amateur wrestlers; they had the same taste in women; they had similar speech patterns. The media at the time ate this up, with their appearances on talk shows designed to leave the audience stunned at their similarities. However, as the documentary goes on, the argument shifts, with the brothers themselves admitting they emphasised their similarities at the time, and the media was more than happy to ignore any differences, leading to what was apparently a clear win for biological determinism. As time went on, their differences began coming to the surface, and ultimately, the documentary very much argues in favour of nurture.

However, how it goes about establishing this argument is extremely questionable, with Wardle sliding more and more into sensationalism. So intent is he on controlling our perceptions that he leaves out a massive piece of information until such time as he deems it pertinent to reveal, and when he does so, he explicitly tells us what to think about it, pushing us to one specific response, when the event cries out for a more ambiguous presentation. It's difficult to go into any of this without straying into spoilers, so consider the rest of this paragraph a spoiler. Essentially, Wardle paints the suicide of one of the brothers as unquestionably the result of his adopted father's harsh disciplinarian parenting, a father who is still alive, and who appears in the film. Wardle and Harte do this by cutting from a clip of that father wondering if he had a role in the suicide to one of the other brothers basically saying, to paraphrase, ""_I'm still alive because my parents weren't as strict as his_."" Blaming his death entirely on parenting in this manner is facile, grossly overly simplistic, and offensive. In fact, the way Wardle handles the suicide in general is deplorable, teasing it and teasing it, before gleefully revealing it for maximum tabloid-esque shock value. The sense of Wardle manipulating the material isn't helped by the fact that the absence of the third brother from the talking head interviews tips off the audience from the get-go as to where the story is heading. Why not just state it right up front, cutting back on the silly twist element of the narrative? It's not like people would get up and walk out upon seeing a ""spoiler"" like that at the outset – this is a documentary, not an M. Night Shyamalan film.

There are other problems, however. Aesthetically, the documentary is drab and dull, almost lifeless. With nothing cinematic about it whatsoever, it could easily be a report from a TV news magazine show, designed for maximum exposure rather than artistic inventiveness. The recreations are bland, and the talking head interviews are flat. Additionally, twin studies are a recognised and accepted scientific practice, but Wardle is so intent on making sure we are appalled at what happened to the brothers that he provides almost no context whatsoever. If he had spent less time trying to steer the viewers' emotions and more in providing a broader theoretical framework, the film would have worked much better, allowing the audience to find their own position in relation to what was done rather than simply following the director's lead. He also ignores a great deal of potentially interesting material. For example, why did their restaurant fail? According to the film, it was because of ""_different work styles_"". Which means absolutely nothing. Why does he not go into this a little? In fact, we never really get any sense of what the brothers' day-to-day life was like after they found each other. When they moved in together, how did that feel, for example? It's as if he doesn't want to dig too deep into anything just in case he finds something that might not fit into the grand narrative he's constructing.

The story of T_hree Identical Strangers_ poses fascinating questions about nature vs. nurture and the morality of certain types of research, but the film is so intent on the ""nurture"" answer that Wardle's subjective opinion comes across far more than it ought. More interested in driving home the shock value of some of the events than providing a penetrating documentary about free will vs biological determinism, there is little here that a reader wouldn't be able to find on Google. Given the outrageousness of the material, that Wardle has made such a conventional film is disappointing. It's an interesting enough piece, but that's more to do with the fascinating subject than the presentation, with the whole thing feeling a little too much like a Wikipedia entry.,","adoption,twins,triplet,mental illness,adopted,nature vs nurture,separated at birth,",4,19,"Tim Wardle,"

Moe Berg was a professional baseball player who played for a number of teams as a backup catcher over his 16 year career. He also had a knack for languages and this led him to working for the Office of Strategic Services during the second world war. One of his missions during the war is the subject of the 2018 movie _The Catcher Was a Spy_.

Paul Rudd plays Berg, and as the movie starts, we meet him during his baseball career. With the war unfolding the US begins working on The Manhattan Project and they suspect that there are some scientists in Germany who are also close to completing a nuclear bomb of some sort. Berg is despatched to Switzerland to look into one of the lead scientists and determine how close the Germans are to having a bomb. If they were close, Berg was to shoot the scientist. It's a small scale story told against the large scale of a world war, and the enormous pressure of the nuclear arms race.

This has a number of big names in it such as Tom Wilkinson, Mark Strong, Sienna Miller, Guy Pearce, Paul Giamatti, Jeff Daniels, and of course Paul Rudd in the lead as Moe Berg. I really enjoyed this and found myself drawn into the story. Rudd is engaging as the mysterious Berg and does a really good job of bringing this enigmatic character to life.

This is not a big loud action extravaganza, but rather an understated film, which is apropo as this is how Moe Berg was in real life. I think this movie flew under the radar when it came out, but I reckon it's definitely worth your time.,","spy,based on novel or book,baseball,world war ii,biography,based on a true story,espionage,lgbt,boston red sox,oss (office of strategic services),closeted homosexual,gay,",55,48,"Ben Lewin,"

Sure it has the mandatory _Mad Max_ ripoffs that you find in every single post-apocalyptic movie of the past thirty years, but there is at least a single relatively original idea, and a couple of moderately interesting side characters.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._,Really good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

Despite a lot of very obvious problems this movie has, it is surprisingly refreshing.  It takes what can sometimes be a boring setting of ""post apocalyptic dystopia"" and does a lot of new things with it.

Notably they cast Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane, ""Superman Returns""), Tyler Hoechlin (CW Superman), and Lance Reddick (The Haitian, ""Heroes"") who all give a great performance for the situations they are given, generally against faceless, or at least generic, forces of violence.

What really irked me when I noticed it, is that the order of events isn't necessarily important: it's like someone wrote the script like an SNL movie, just a bunch of sketches pieced together, but instead of humor it was violent survival strategy situations.  This is unique enough that I actually enjoyed it conceptually.

One of the more refreshing things is that the universe has a narrator in the form of a radio DJ that puts the rumors he gets into legend, making the movie feel very ""Old West"" at points, without slowing the movie down with an entirely separate scene.

It also directly addressing survival strategies and explores the mindset of people that are forced out into the open when they have to move through held territory.

There is a lot that is bland, but there is more that is exciting and interesting in this survival thriller.  Give it a go if you can handle people shooting each other.,","husband wife relationship,post-apocalyptic future,gang,violence,cannibalism,survive,",57,15,"Mike P. Nelson,"

The humor in the realistic dialogue, and the charm of the ""moving"" pictures the lead character supposedly drew were a fun element of the otherwise cliched script. I swear if another movie about a British residential school for boys includes a scene of the dork kid being lowered upside down into a toilet or trash can, I will stop watching it. It is so common in these types of movies that it has become boring. How refreshing it would be to show the ""bullies"" having brains and doing something completely different, like sarcastically treating new or dorky kids as royalty, bowing to them and praising them, which the kids knowing it was fake and wondering where it might lead.

I had a slight problem with the fact that a few of the characters were French, and sometimes they had conversations that weren't translated. I assume that either the version I viewed lacked the translation accidentally, or else those conversations weren't critical to the story. I also wasn't thrilled with the ending, which I won't reveal here. I guess they must have wanted to avoid what seemed to be the two obvious endings and went with a third choice instead.

Generally, I like movies from The Asylum, and I can put up with a lot of bad movies.  This movie, however, was just terrible.  I could not find anything in this movie that I would consider redeemable, and I _Jurassic Prey_ a B+. This movie was just bad.

**Storyline (1/5)**:  The general idea of the movie, if they had actually done anything with it, was that a company wanted to use dinosaurs to create replacement body parts for humans.  Interesting idea... that they did absolutely nothing with.  Instead, they chose to go with a story about dinosaurs getting loose in a laboratory and just killing everyone, which would generally be okay, but I just didn't give a crap about any of the characters.

**Characters (2/5)**:  The characters in this movie were so bland they were almost derivative.  They were also completely unlikeable.  In most bad movies, you can at least root for the characters, even if you know they're probably going to die at some point.  But even the main character you can get behind and hope nothing happens to them.  In this movie, if everyone died, I figured the world would be better off.  Even at the end, when the main character was saved, I just didn't care.

**Directing (1/5)**:  I wish I could say the director at least tried, except he tried to copy other directors who did this type of movie better and didn't seem to put any real effort into his job.  It's almost as if he read the script and didn't add any flare to it.  His directing was dry, overly dramatic, and too serious for a movie like this.  I don't mind movies being dramatic, but seriously, this is a movie about dinosaurs being harvested for their organs.  Have a little fun with it.

**Casting (2/5)**:  Most of the time with Asylum movies, the casting may not be great, but the actors are at least likeable.  None of the actors in this movie were likeable, and it wasn't just the roles they were playing (see below).

**Acting (3/5)**: The actors took their roles entirely too seriously, and I have to assume the director was responsible.  I assume when being cast, he said something along the lines of ""This is going to be a movie to rival Jurassic Park.  I want you to put everything you have into your roles.""  Then he starts swinging a watch before their eyes in a hypnotizing manner.  ""This is not a straight-to-video movie.  This is an Oscar-winning movie.  You need to give an Oscar-winning performance.  When you wake up, you will take this movie seriously!""  *Snap*  Unfortunately, the actors made you not care about their characters.

**Music (3/5)**: The music fit the movie pretty well: It was dry, dull, and did nothing to make this movie exciting.  It fit into the background very well and was utterly and completely forgettable.  3 out of 5 might be too generous, but at least the music wasn't horrendous.

**Cinematography (3/5)**: For the most part, the cinematography was pretty good in this movie.  The dinosaurs didn't look like crap, but I've seen better dinosaurs on YouTube.  Camera work all around was solid, so not real complaints here.

**Production Design (3/5)**:  The corporate laboratory setting wasn't bad, but it did look like a cheap set in many places.  And the layout was sometimes confusing.  Costumes looked okay and nothing seemed out of place.

**Pacing (3/5)**:  For a short movie, the pacing was very slow.  There were points were I kept checking the time to see how much time was left and sorely disappointed by how much time was left.

**Enjoyment (1/5)**:  I did not like this movie.  I did not like the plot, I did not like the characters—-I did not like anything about it.  For an Asylum movie, this was one of the worst I've seen.  I recommend avoiding it unless you just want to torture yourself. Go watch *Jurassic Prey* instead--it's bad, but at least it knows it's bad.,","dinosaur,jurassic,",11,4,"Dylan Vox,"

> _Female sexuality, I think's a huge subject that we don't get to delve into that much and I was really interested in showing that on screen. It's something you always get to see, where the man is the instigator of all the sexual relationships and romances. And I wanted the female in this to be who's going after what she wanted and was being very direct and proactive about that. To me, that's what I have seen in many young women, they are very strong-willed and they have their own wants and I thought that would be an interesting angle for it; that we haven't seen_ _much of it._

- Aoife McArdle; ""'I wanted to make a film that was visceral and dangerous and had a woman at the centre'"" (Aoife Barry); _TheJournal.ie_ (June 24, 2018)

_Kissing Candice_ is the debut feature from Northern Irish writer/director Aoife McArdle, whose career thus far has been primarily in music videos and commercials (she's probably best known for the controversial _American Psycho_-inspired video for Bryan Ferry's 2014 song, ""Loop De Li"", and the truncated short film for U2's 2015 song, ""Every Breaking Wave""). When a music video director moves onto features, problems can arise, and _Kissing Candice_ features many of them; the whole thing plays like a two-hour Lorde video, all deep primary colours (especially red) with no discernible diegetic source; self-congratulatory and often belaboured visual symbolism; oblique narrative justification for many of the scenes; an achronological structure with unannounced flashbacks (think Joseph Conrad's _The Secret Agent_ (1907), except not nearly as well handled), and portentous staring into the middle-distance as the actors emote at one another instead of talking. The film is especially weak in terms of narrative - the entire plot takes up no more than a half hour at most, with the rest all mood and tone.

However, for all that, I rather liked it. The plot, such as it is, is actually built on an interesting enough hook. Set on an unnamed council estate in Dundalk some time after the cessation of the Troubles, Candice (Ann Skelly) is a contemplative, but rebellious youngster (the love child of Terrence Malick and Larry Clark, if you will). As the film begins, she is in the midst of an intense dream involving a young man she doesn't recognise. Several days later, she is stunned when she meets kind-hearted local gang member Jacob (Ryan Lincoln), who looks exactly like the man in her dreams. Jacob has been butting heads with increasing frequency with the gang's leader, Dermot (an excellent Conall Keating), who may or may not have been involved with the disappearance of a young boy from the estate, Caleb (Jason Cullen), who has also been featuring in Candice's recent dreams.

Anyone familiar with McArdle's work will instantly see the thematic uniformity - like many of her music videos, _Kissing Candice_ depicts troubled youth, cut free from adult supervision and influence, going to extremes. And whilst McArdle proves fairly inept at handling the narrative, the film is aesthetically very well mounted, as we're literally placed within Candice's not-entirely-stable psyche from the off (the hallucinatory opening sequence is especially good in this respect). As the plot outline may suggest, there's a definite vibe of Ryan Gosling's critically reviled (but actually rather good) directorial debut _Lost River_ (2014), and McArdle is obviously influenced by Nicholas Winding Refn and, to a lesser extent, David Lynch.

McArdle is clearly talented. However, it might help her career if she directs someone else's script next time, as her writing is what really lets her down here. Nevertheless, it's well acted, looks amazing, and, as debuts go, is not too bad at all.,","isolation,dream,friendship,gang,teenage girl,disappearance,magic realism,woman director,the troubles,",21,23,"Aoife McArdle,"

It follows teenager Murdo as he travels from Scotland to Alabama following the death of his mother. Murdo plays the accordion, but the tragic disruption in his life has caused him to set it aside for a while. It starts out as a sort of road movie, then, before settling down a bit.

During a lull in the trip by bus to Alabama, Murdo hears accordion music being played. He seeks it out and finds Queen Monzee-ay, a regionally well-known cajun singer performing. He gets to know her and she invites him to perform with her in an upcoming event. Her attention and his experience with her people awakens Murdo's interest in his music. This causes a slight rift between him and his father, who out of good intentions is perhaps a bit controlling of his son.

I really enjoyed this movie. The story is strong and told simply. No flashbacks or dream sequences - what we get is a drama about grief and family, strong characters in an ensemble cast, and a lot of music. It doesn't hurt that I really enjoy Cajun music.

If I could suggest anything, I would like to have seen a bit more conversation between father and son. There is a lot of silent staring and halting tidbits which do convey their sense of loss. But as someone who lost my father and a brother at a young age, and whose family didn't talk a lot about it either, I felt I could almost have written some strong scenes of dialogue to show more character growth. But that is a minor observation. I would recommend the film to anyone, as long as they also enjoy or at least tolerate the music.,",,12,4,"Kenneth Glenaan,"

Officially, the censorship system is designed to promote Confucian morality, political stability and social harmony, which means that features are often removed from reality and didactic in tone. Enter upcoming director Wang Jinsong, whose How Far Tomorrow? is one of the very first Chinese movies to tackle the grim reality of rising recreational drug use head-on. Following in the footsteps of modern classics such as Requiem for a Dream and 21 Grams, the film follows happy wife and mother Yu Lanben, whose life spirals out of control when she stumbles across her town’s seedy underbelly and quickly falls victim to addiction. A blistering critique of China’s public welfare system and the dangerousness of excess, as well as a groundbreaking work of social realism, this is a trailblazing vision from a filmmaker whose star is very much the rise.",0.6,/jNBbYumGonB3WuEW3QmTyujOhjF.jpg,2018-06-26,0,,Released,,How Far is Tomorrow,False,0.0,0,"Drama,",,,"zh,",,0,,,0,1,"Jinsong Yang,"

I've rarely seen movies speak a little, but say a lot, and this movie does this. 

I've had the good fortune to see this in Fantasia 2019, and I would highly recommend it to people who want to watch some finely crafted stop motion, touching tastefully on sensitive subjects with a strong, novel, poetic, and visual metaphoric excellence!,So, is this the 'Animal Farm' adaption you've been waiting for all your life? Probably not. 'S He' is all kinds of wacky, and whilst some of it elicits welcomed breathtaking moments, some of it is just too much. But this is exactly the kind of film that could leave a bigger impact than you can imagine, so I encourage anyone who is even slightly curious to please check this one out. If you can look past the shoes, there are important lessons and values being taught by a visionary director, willing to take risks - and that should always be applauded.
