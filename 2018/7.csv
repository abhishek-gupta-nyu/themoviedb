_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._,Actually quite good! It's like a less-weird, but more fun version of a Deadpool - in the sense that it is both filled with action but also with fun acting.

I recommend it for a Saturday evening. It is quite wholesome.,I did indeed enjoy this movie‚Ä¶somewhat. However I cannot say that I was overly impressed.

The story was okay. I would not expect a deep and thought provoking story from a super hero movie nor would I want it. It served as a decent enough vehicle for moving things forward.

Most of the actors did a good enough job of the role they were given which in some cases was pretty much mission impossible given some of the overly silly characters in the movie. In particular I got tired of Luis almost before the first scenes he was in had finished. He was just so silly that you started to wonder what age the target audience was. Jimmy Woo was not far behind.

I think this leads to my main gripe with the movie. I expected a super hero movie but what I got was a fairly lame comedy with super heroes in it. It was just too much comic elements in it for me. I could probably have liked it if the jokes were somewhat intelligent but, for me, they were not. They alternated between overly silly and stupid characters, slap-stick and simple fall-on-your ass jokes.

What about the bad guy? Well, first off, there was not really a distinct bad guy but a hole bunch of them. Unfortunately none of them had any real bad guy charisma. I assume that Sonny was supposed to be the main bad guy and he certainly had enough evil lunatic air about him to fit that but again‚Ä¶too silly. Then we have the lame Jimmy Woo who was just annoying. The Ghost was probably the best one but then she was not really a bad guy was she?

I did like most of the action and the special effects though. The playing around with shrinking and returning to normal size, or greater, was both cool and funny. This shrinking business is of course a difficult theme to work with from a science and logic point of view. For instance, if you shrink a car to the size of a toy car it still weighs like a full size one and you cannot just pick it up. And what about the lab popping up and down all the time? Why weren‚Äôt everything shaken to bits inside when they started to run around with it? And don‚Äôt get me started about electricity and plumbing. But then, in this kind of movie I would say just just have to turn off that part of your brain. It made for some cool scenes after all.

I also did like that the story was more of a down to Earth story. No overall galactic plot, no snapping of fingers to make‚Ä¶well you know what. Okay, there was the post credit scenes which was a bit of an annoying tie in. Perhaps best of all though, I could not really feel much SJW or other form of politically correct preaching being showed down my throat. Today that is a great plus for any movie.

So, to sum up, I did enjoy it but it was not great and I was indeed a little bit disappointed at the end.,For fans of the first one, which includes me, Ant-Man and the Wasp is more of what you like. More heisting. More car chases. More Giant Man. More of the three wombats. More humour. More mediocre villains. More romance between Scott and Hope. More family bonding. And of course, more quantum realm. It's fun. It's light hearted. It works.

That post credit scene though .... üò≤,‚ÄúAnt-Man and the Wasp‚Äù is a really weird Marvel movie.

Like its pint-sized superhero, the film doesn‚Äôt quite fit in with the typical MCU big screen canon and is a laid back yet thoroughly forgettable entry into the fatigued superhero genre. The story doesn‚Äôt try to tie too much together (save for a mid-credits scene), there‚Äôs not an over-dependence on rambunctious CGI effects, and the attempts at humor feel oddly forced (I‚Äôd estimate only 30% of the jokes land successfully). Despite the lame title characters and the ever-likeable Paul Rudd‚Äòs offhand charisma, this film gives the impression that it‚Äôs an average C student trying desperately to overcome underdog status and achieve a place on the honor roll.

The best part of the film besides Rudd (he makes this one, just like every movie he‚Äôs cast in, impossible not to enjoy at least a little), are the special effects. Sure, they‚Äôre all computer generated, but they‚Äôre some of the most creative since 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄúDoctor Strange.‚Äù The worst part of the film is its contrived humor. It‚Äôs stiff, often cringe-worthy, and sticks out like a sore thumb as it grows increasingly desperate. The film‚Äôs multiple writers couldn‚Äôt have helped things, and the barrage of thoughtless, lazy jokes quickly wore me down.

Also lacking is suspense and a viable antagonist. There‚Äôs the oddly disturbing Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), a woman who is living in unbearable pain and appears to be a formidable foe for Ant-Man (Rudd), The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). But then she suddenly finds her heart and the evil disappears. The same goes for Dr. Foster (Laurence Fishburne), a professor who also has a near immediate change of heart. The thin rescue mission premise of extracting Hank‚Äôs wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the Quantum Realm after being trapped there for the last 30 years also means there‚Äôs not too much else to root for.

The quantum rules change on a whim to fit the action sequences, with a sometimes shrinking and sometimes growing super suit. And cars. And buildings. The exposition dialogue is long-winded and repetitive, and the ill-advised ‚Äúcomic‚Äù relief from Michael Pe√±a is not snarky enough to feel fresh or new (see ‚ÄúThor: Ragnarok‚Äú).

This is a shallow, pointless film that becomes an exhausting bore.,I have the impression that this movie is not a favorite of the hardcore Marvel community, which makes sense, as I am not part of that community and this is flat out my favorite entry into the Marvel line. In fact, it is the only Marvel film I have recommended my wife watch with me. (She hasn‚Äôt taken me up on it yet.)

I like the humor from the Scott Lang character and its self-deprecating tendency. Perhaps it would be over the top in a more serious entry like the infinity movies, but it works here. I really enjoy the chemistry between him and his daughter and I even appreciate the Luis character, which apparently separates me from the serious Marvel viewers. It is a fun ride and is not so much fueled by the violence of the other entries in the genre. 

In fact, the only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the bittersweet way this movie is tied into the Infinity universe, regarding Scott (Ant-Man) and his daughter. And since that happens off in a different film altogether, it allows the story within this movie to stand on its own. If the reason you haven‚Äôt watched this is because you aren‚Äôt into the rest of the Marvel series or are worried about not getting it out of sequence, don‚Äôt worry. It stands on its own.,The Ant-man and Wasp is simple, silly movie with some redeeming features.  It grew on me despite the silly acting and twisting plot that had a few unnecessary scenes. The special effects were pretty good, and I liked most of the combat scenes. They went a little overboard with CGI, which broke through my suspension of disbelief on a few occasions. 

There were too many characters who played a weak villain. None of them felt like a real threat to any of the heroes. That gave the movie a very cartoonish feel. 

What was weird that Ant-man's love interest Wasp, played by Evangeline Lilly, looked like she could have been his mother! Every time they showed affection for each other, like when they kissed, I recoils with a mental ""ewww, this is gross!"". Wasp was like a cougar hunting Paul Rudd.

Overall, the movie was enjoyable as long as you don't question its science, since it wouldn't work even if you believe their explanation of the quantum realm. 

Final note, skip the credits and there is a scene in there to tie it into the rest of the MCU. The scene is entirely unecessary, and it ruins the actual ending of the movie. They should have left it out.,","insect,ant,shrinking,sequel,superhero,based on comic,miniaturization,giant man,aftercreditsstinger,duringcreditsstinger,marvel cinematic universe,",75,470,"Peyton Reed,"

I feel at least.

Now neither of these films are perfect, but the first _Unfriended_ movie was okaaaaaaaaay, and this one has managed to push it by the skin of it's teeth over in to what I could honestly argue is ""good"".

But you sure as hell don‚Äôt expect a doctor to, and yet, Sarah Sawyer can not only steal a gun pointed at her, she can stop a burning building‚Äôs fire without even being in the building!

Will Sawyer‚Äôs posed with a challenge when the tablet that he was for some reason given with full control of the security system and just about everything else about the building, gets stolen, the building set on fire, and his family stuck above the fire with little means to get out.

Will, who is now a suspect, takes it upon himself to enter the burning building, get his family, and leave the burning building. This isn‚Äôt as easy as that sounds, because there‚Äôs a MacGuffin to be gotten and the people that set the building on fire will stop at nothing to get it. Oh, and did I mention **he only has one leg!**

_Minor spoilers ahead._

Skyscraper was extremely predictable, the only thing I didn‚Äôt see coming was the fact that they wasted five minutes of our time showing Will telling Sarah to turn off and back on her phone to fix it, just to set up the ending where Sarah turns off and back on the building to stop the fire.

The one thing I did enjoy from this film was near the ending when they‚Äôre in _The Pearl_, but you don‚Äôt watch a movie for a single scene.

Rawson Thurber should stick to comedy, where he has experience. This is a waste of the $125,000,000 it took to make it, and it‚Äôs a waste of the $12 to watch it. Skip this one.,Well, if you are a fan of The Rock this is a decent enough high octane action, disaster and special effects movie. If not, well then you probably have to be a pretty big fan of special effects and action to overlook its weak points.

Let‚Äôs start with the good stuff. One, it is The Rock (yes I am a fan) although he certainly doesn‚Äôt come out at his best in this movie. Personally I could do without the artificial leg crap but it didn‚Äôt bother me too much in the end. It didn‚Äôt really add anything except some silly (and unrealistic scenes) though.

Then we have the action and the special effects. They were as good as you would expect from a multi million dollar action movie. At least I enjoyed them. I really liked the design of the Skyscraper. I thought it was booth cool and beautiful. I kind of would like to see it built in real life.

Was the movie derivative? Well of course it can be said to be derivative! How many movies with burning Skyscrapers and bad guys hi-jacking them can you make before it becomes derivative after all? The first movie named Skyscraper was made in 1928 for Christ sake. It didn‚Äôt bother me at all.

Now for the not so good. The movie was hugely predictable. I mean, you could tell who the bad guys were from the first scene they were in. Especially the rat faced jerk Mr Pierce. The main bad guy? Well, he was no Hans Gruber that‚Äôs for sure. More like a common thug. The movie really lacked a bad guy with some charisma. Overall, most of the movie from start to finish was really a no-surprise-there event from the first bad guy entering the scene to the rebooting of the systems.

Then we have the realism factor. I do not expect an action and special effects movie to be realistic but there are some limits. Sawyer climbing around on the outside of the building (with one leg remember) in the updraft from 50 or so burning levels was just nonsense. Also, a building burning that much and that long and yet all the electrical wiring and plumbing still working was a bit too much. The absolutely worst offence though was how everyone magically survived sitting in the middle of the fire being extinguished by the release of halon gas (or some equivalent). That just brings stupidity (or maybe laziness) in script writing to a whole new level.

So, to sum it up, this move could have been a lot better. To me it was saved by The Rock and my love of special effects loaded action movies.,_Die Hard in a (X)_ is a pretty classic movie formula, it doesn't get as much play now as it did in the 80s and 90s, but we can still reliably expect at **least** one every couple of years, even now. But when it's _Die Hard in a Skyscraper_... I mean... That's just _Die Hard_. Even _Die Hard 2_ had the sensibility to be _Die Hard in an Airport_.

Except that, no, this isn't just _Die Hard_, because (and I don't think anyone would be shocked to find this) it's not as good. I mean I love The Rock and all, but come on.

Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product.,It's an ultimate frame of mind movie.

It is what it is, it's Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the hero of the tale who has to achieve the impossible when the world's tallest building catches fire. His family is trapped in said building inferno and there's bad guys running around creating trouble.

So sit down and get ready for fantastically high energy action scenes and hold your breath peril sequences. You have to be in the right frame of mind for this type of entertainment, to understand it's a blockbusting popcorn piece made to take you out of the real world, it does not have cranial splendours or social commentary.

It's great to have Neve Campbell back kicking butt, rising above just being a female token waiting to be saved by her heroic husband. And of course if you can't smile at the makers having Johnson being handicapped with an artificial leg - and still turning into Usain Bolt for various scenes - then this isn't the film for you.

Some way short of the classy verve of The Towering Inferno or the brutal brilliance of Die Hard, this does its job handsomely enough for the like minded souls after some escapist carnage. 6/10,","china,fire,skyscraper,hong kong,high tech,security system,pearl,penthouse,world's tallest building,trapped in burning building,",57,128,"Rawson Marshall Thurber,"

Perhaps it has to do with the 56-year-old Tom Cruise who defies age and pushes his physical boundaries for our viewing pleasure? The answer is quite evident in ‚ÄòFallout‚Äô as his Ethan Hunt is as good as a caped superhero in the sixth film of the series. The story isn't all that new with its twists and turns. But ‚ÄòFallout‚Äô manages to build on the previous films in the series by bringing back old friends and foes, besides adding some new ones. Henry Cavill as August Walker fits right into this universe as the hammer to the scalpel that is Ethan Hunt. His presence is looming enough to fill the entire screen whenever he appears. Simon Pegg takes on the status of a series regular alongside Ving Rhames, whose Benji and Luther respectively play more than just mere sidekicks as they add comic levity and heart. Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett also make a mark in their brief appearances but watch out for impactful turns by Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan along the way.

Writer & Director Christopher McQuarrie allows each character to shine while building on their history with each other, thus making them endearing to the audience. This only serves to up the ante when they‚Äôre in danger. McQuarrie also lets the story breathe by bringing some calm before the storm hits. Which leads to the most crucial aspect of the series, and one that McQuarrie clearly excels at in this film ‚Äì the action sequences. Not only are they meticulously planned; they are executed with precision, even when the fist fights are gritty and gruesome. Rob Hardy beautifully choreographs the camerawork following these intricate set-pieces, either allowing you to take in the expanse or bringing you up close and personal when required. This is paired with a soundtrack by Lorne Balfe that lends to the tension by giving the iconic ‚ÄòMission Impossible‚Äô theme a sinister sense of urgency.

McQuarrie has now directed two ‚ÄòMission: Impossible‚Äô films; his understanding of the franchise and its characters proves to be the secret weapon of the series. The fact that the stunts are largely done with practical effects featuring the cast, and most prominently Cruise himself, sets a whole new standard for action films. ‚ÄòMission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout‚Äô is a great mix of plot, pacing and performances that is undeniably the best entry in the franchise, while it re-establishes Cruise‚Äôs status as an action superstar.

Review by Times of India (TOI)
Final Rating - 4.0/5,Mission Impossible - Fallout is a continuation of Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation. It is directed by Christopher McQuarrie who also directed Rogue Nation and also has the return of the psycho villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) who the bad guys want to set free.

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is after the mysterious John Lark and a terrorist group called the Apostles who have stolen three plutonium grade devices and plan to set them off.

Hunt has to reluctantly accept a new team member. CIA operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) because the IMF team were responsible for losing the plutonium in Berlin.

As a spy thriller there is enough tension, thrills and a serpentine story with several twists.

However the film is overlong and I felt that some of the action scenes consisted of myriad chase scenes that were stylishly done but nothing really memorable liked the Burj Khalifa climbing scene.,Excellent story line with tremendous stunts by Tom Cruise himself. This movie is worth every penny that you spend.,I have to say I have not been a great fan of the Mission Impossible movies. Sure, there‚Äôs plenty of action and cool stunts but I do not feel they follow the spirit of the TV-show. In the TV-show they got their mission and then they completed it, tricking the bad guys, with the full backing of the IMF team. No political bullshit, betrayal of the team and such like nonsense.

However, in pretty much every movie Ethan or the entire IMF team was betrayed or set up and he had to, not only complete his mission but, clear IMF from whatever shenanigans the story writers had dreamed up. The movies have been Mission Impossible in name only. I wonder if the moron script writers has ever watched the show.

In this movie too there is indeed a bunch of political nonsense and betrayal. Shit that I could be without. But at least IMF and Ethan‚Äôs team are on his side throughout the movie. There are also a few clever parts where they trick the bad guys in a good old fashioned Mission Impossible style.

Otherwise the movie is mostly a classical Hollywood action adventure/thriller movie. Plenty of, more or less, non stop action. There are a few of the usual WTF story holes and defiance of physics when it comes to the stunts of course. The dumbass CIA director was a completely unnecessary element though.

Still, overall I found this installment in the franchise to be one of the better ones. Maybe even the best one yet.,Movie was good but its not better than ghost protocol.,They just keep getting better, but they never get good.

- Spike Lee; ""_BlacKkKlansman_'s Spike Lee On Trump's Legacy, Harry Belafonte & 2020 Election - Awardsline Screening Series""; _Deadline_ (January 10, 2019)

_BlacKkKlansman_ is a film with a whole hell of a lot on its mind. It opens with one of the most (in)famous scenes from Victor Fleming's _Gone with the Wind_ (1939), before pivoting to a fictional precursor of Alex Jones lecturing the audience on the dangers of the ""negroid"", and later takes in everything from Kwame Ture and the All-African People's Revolutionary Party to David Duke and his political aspirations, before lambasting D.W. Griffith's _The Birth of a Nation_ (1915), criticising the tropes of classic Blaxploitation films such as Gordon Parks's _Shaft_ (1971), Gordon Parks Jr.'s _Super Fly_ (1972), and Jack Hill's _Coffy_ (1973), going into agonising detail regarding the 1916 lynching of Jesse Washington, sardonically criticising police bureaucracy, and concluding with a montage of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, including raw footage of James Alex Fields, Jr. ploughing a car into a crowd of counter-protestors, resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, intercut with Duke championing Donald Trump's presidency, and Trump's own reluctance to condemn the Neo Nazi/white supremacist component of the rally. The film then ends with an evocatively worded tribute to Heyer, before fading to an upside-down black and white American flag (which is not, as is often stated, a political protest, but is actually a governmentally approved signal for ""dire distress""). Yep; this is a film with a lot to say.

At its core, _BlacKkKlansman_ is about institutional racism in the United States. Ostensibly dealing with the 1970s manifestation of such, the film's real point is that in 2018, not only is such racism still a problem, it's now even more endemic, due to its pseudo-legitimacy in the wake of Trump's election, and the concomitant upsurge in hate crime across the country. The film holds a mirror up to the contemporary era by way of presenting an historical event which both underlines the inherent nonsensicality of white supremacist attitudes, whilst also pointing out just how dangerous idiots like this can be in a country where guns are so readily available, where being a member of an organised hate group is not illegal, and where the belief that ""white is right"" reaches to the upper echelons of power.

On the surface, the film plays out as you would expect from the trailer - it's a frequently hilarious look at the true story of how a black police officer infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. In 1979, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) became the first black officer in the Colorado Springs PD. Initially assigned to the records room, Stallworth talks his way into an undercover investigation run by Detectives Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) and Jimmy Creek (Michael Buscemi), who have him attend a lecture being given by Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins) with orders to report on the mood and attitudes of the crowd. Although taken with Ture's rhetoric, Stallworth nevertheless carries out his assignment, and is subsequently transferred to intelligence. Seeing an advert for KKK membership in the newspaper, Stallworth rings the number on a whim. Pretending to hate everyone who doesn't have ""pure white Aryan blood running through their veins"", Stallworth is invited to meet. He then hatches an insane plan to use Zimmerman as the in-person Stallworth, whilst Stallworth himself will continue the phone conversations. At the meet-and-greet, Zimmerman/Stallworth is introduced to the unstable Felix Kendrickson (a superb Jasper P√§√§kk√∂nen), who is immediately suspicious of him. Nevertheless, he's approved for membership. However, unhappy with how long the paperwork is taking, Stallworth rings KKK headquarters, and is shocked to find himself on the phone with ""Grand Wizard"" David Duke (Topher Grace), who he impresses to such an extent that Duke promises to expedite his membership.

And with this completely barmy premise as the hook, co-writer/director Spike Lee (_Do the Right Thing_; _Malcolm X_) has made his best film since _25th Hour_ (2002), and his funniest since _Bamboozled_ (2000), possibly the funniest of his career. Of course, Lee is far from the first person to see humour in the idea of a black person joining a white supremacist organisation ‚Äì perhaps the best known example is Dave Chappelle's character, Clayton Bigsby, a blind black man unaware of his ethnicity, who has become the leader of a local KKK sect. However, where the film is unique, and where it excels, is in how Lee uses history to offer viciously trenchant commentary on race relations in 2018.

His combative intent is signalled in the first scene, which is actually a scene from another film; _Gone with the Wind_, as Scarlett O'Hara (Vivian Leigh) looks for Dr. Meade (Harry Davenport) in the wake of the Battle of Atlanta in July 1864. A resounding victory for the Union, the battle bolstered confidence in Abraham Lincoln's leadership, and precipitated the Confederate States of America's surrender the following year. The scene depicts O'Hara picking her way through the thousands of wounded and dead Confederate States' soldiers as a crane shot pulls back to show the devastation, finally coming to rest on a tattered Confederate Navy Jack. The implication here, as elsewhere in the film, is clear ‚Äì this is very much the world of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, the belief that prior to Reconstruction, the Antebellum South was an urbane and benign society, with the Confederacy heroically fighting the corrupt Union so as to preserve the inherently honourable southern way of life. Important in this skewered worldview is the contention that the practice of slavery was a benevolent institution, protecting the ""coloureds"" from their own worst predilections, and who, rather than being abused, were treated like members of the family who owned them. Lee first saw Gone with the Wind on a third-grade class trip, and of the experience, he states,

> _that film disturbed me. The imagery of Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen ‚Äì ""I don't know nuthin' 'bout birthin' no babies"" ‚Äì I mean, there was no discussion at all about the imagery._

Lee keeps up the confrontational tack in the film's second scene, as _BlacKkKlansman_ segues into the first of two key scenes to reference another important filmic text set during the Civil War; D.W. Griffith's 1915 masterpiece _The Birth of a Nation_. This scene depicts the fictional cultural anthropologist Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard (Alec Baldwin), who, in grainy black-and-white footage tries to alert the audience to the fact that the negorids are attempting to take over the country. Obviously inspired by maniacs like Alex Jones, Beauregard is about as irrational as they come, and his frustration as he continually flubs his lines superbly undercuts any claim he may have to seriousness. But what's especially well done is how Lee uses _Birth_ to mock this type of individual. As footage of the film plays behind Beauregard, his face is erased of its colour ‚Äì he is literally rendered white enough to become part of the projected image, which, of course, depicts a narrative built around the inherently virtuous nature of being white. It's a powerful shot that clearly tells us, yes, this is a comedy, and yes, these people are ridiculous, but also alerting us to the fact that Lee is not playing around here; he's going to use every filmic tool in his arsenal to get his point across.

And what is that point? The cultural instability of the United States in 2018, with its entrenched institutional racism, an entire race of people once again being treated like second class citizens because of the amount of melanin in their skin, hateful rhetoric masquerading as national pride, the breakdown of the distinction between xenophobia and patriotism, and the transition of hate crimes from the fringes of society into the realm of social acceptability. The film suggests that organisational racism once existed half-way between the absurd and the dangerous, but in recent years, it has moved in the wrong direction. Even before we get to the chilling closing montage, Lee and his co-writers (Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, and Kevin Willmott) have dropped a few subtle allusions to Trump's presidency. In one scene, Stallworth confidently asserts that it doesn't matter how much of a legitimate businessman Duke becomes, and no matter how much he hides his racism behind more patriotic rhetoric such as immigration and crime, the country would never elect a crass, hate-filled racist as president. In another scene, Duke explains he and the KKK are ""_making America great again_."" These two allusions would be enough to get the point across, but it would also mean that that point remains in the realm of comedy, and is therefore easily dismissed. The closing montage changes that, as it drops all pretence of humour in depicting what happened in Charlottesville, and Trump's asinine response (""_You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides_""). This is very much a state-of-the-nation address.

In relation to _Birth of a Nation_, of course, things are more complicated than they are in relation to _Gone with the Wind_. Yes, the film is horrifically racist, and yes, it was singlehandedly responsible for the 20th-century revival of the KKK, but it is also probably the most important film ever made, and literally wrote the book on screen grammar. Conceivably, _Gone with the Wind_ could be removed from the canon and no longer taught, but _Birth_ absolutely could not. It is a foundational text, an undeniable landmark film, completely independent of its politics. Lee saw it during his first year at NYU, stating,

> _they taught us all of the cinematic innovations Griffith had come up with, but they left out everything that had to do with the social impact of the film. That this film re-energized the Klan. The Klan was dormant, it was dead, and the film brought about a rebirth. Therefore, because of the rebirth of the Klan, it led to black people being lynched, strung up, castrated and murdered, but that was never discussed! I have no problem with Birth of a Nation being screened [‚Ä¶] but let's put it in context, let's discuss it._

_Birth_ is based on Thomas F. Dixon, Jr.'s 1905 novel T_he Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan_ - the second book in his KKK trilogy (the first is _The Leopard's Spots: A Romance of the White Man's Burden - 1865-1900_ (1902), and the third is _The Traitor: A Story of the Fall of the Invisible Empire_ (1907). As these titles suggest, all three novels valorise the practises and institutions designed to oppress black people, whilst depicting emancipated slaves and Yankee carpetbaggers as the ""real"" villains behind the Civil War, positing that the plight of the freedmen during Reconstruction was a direct result of their liberation (i.e., they (and the south in general) would have been better off had they remained slaves). In Dixon's depiction of the lawless society of the south, created by the Union, where coloureds can walk around freely, southern whites have become the target of racial violence, with freedmen being particularly fond of raping white women. In the trilogy, the Klan are depicted as arising from this maelstrom, honourable and heroic men forced to reluctantly take the law into their own hands so as to stop the rampage. So influential was the film that the modern KKK practices of wearing white hoods and burning crosses come from it, not from the original 1865-1871 incarnation of the Klan.

As mentioned, Lee uses the film twice ‚Äì in the Beauregard scene, and in a later scene where his use of it speaks to the formal complexity of his own work. One of the most important of Griffith's innovations was that of parallel editing (better known today as cross-cutting), something we all take for granted in everything from films to commercials to music videos. In a nutshell, parallel editing is when two separate actions from two separate locations are intercut to suggest they are happening simultaneously, often, but not always, to heighten tension. It's one of the most fundamental components of screen grammar, so much so we don't even think about it today ‚Äì we just take it as given. However, Lee's genius in this scene is that he uses _Birth_ to mock the Klan by way of, you guessed it, parallel editing. As the KKK sit down to watch _Birth_, Lee intercuts their enjoyment of its absurdities with Jerome Turner (Harry Belafonte) telling the story of the barbaric lynching of Jesse Washington, which saw a crowd of over 10,000 people in Waco, Texas, cheering on as his testicles and fingers were cut off, after which he was slowly burned to death by being continually raised over a fire. Lee uses parallel editing here so as to have one scene comment on the other ‚Äì he is literally using _Birth_'s own innovations against it and what it represents. _Birth_ may be politically abhorrent, but Lee is savvy enough to not only recognise its technological importance, but to co-opt that importance and use it for his own ends, showing us the stunned reaction to a vicious murder contrasted with a celebration of the conditions which led to that murder.

As all of this may suggest, yes, the film is preachy, but that's because Lee is preaching. He makes no apology for such. This is polemic filmmaking, and the move into heavy didacticism in the final montage is completely earned.

On a more formal level, Lee thematically employs many of the aesthetic devices for which he has become known ‚Äì whether it's a pronounced dutch angle during Stallworth's phone conversations with the KKK to indicate just how surreal the whole thing is, disembodied heads fading into one another during a powerful Ture speech, or, of course, the double dolly shot, which he has used in most of his films to suggest disillusionment and/or the characters' inability to control their own actions as they are inexorably pushed forward, divested of the contextualisation of their environment.

All of this is not to say the film is perfect, however. For example, it relates the apocryphal story that when Woodrow Wilson saw _Birth_, he commented, ""_it is like writing history with lightning_."" Wilson never said this; the quote was most likely the invention of Thomas F. Dixon Jr., who was promoting the film at the time. Lee must know this, and it does his cause no good to perpetuate a lie. How he employs the double dolly also raises some interesting problems, suggesting, as it does, that orthodox black activism and underground black militancy must combine forces in the face of hate. The film also glosses over Stallworth's time in COINTELPRO, where he worked to sabotage radical black organisations, because this doesn't fit into the overarching theme the film is constructing. Making Zimmerman Jewish is also troubling (the real person he was based upon is known only as Chuck, and all we know about him is that he definitely wasn't Jewish). Is Zimmerman supposed to represent Republican voters who abhor the KKK as much as the political left do? Who knows, because beyond being Jewish, there's no further character development; he's more of a rhetorical device, a meme rather than a person with an inner life. Similarly, the fictional explosion towards the end of the story serves to distastefully simplify everything, once more making the KKK look foolish, something which is wholly unnecessary at this point in the film, whilst also positing Stallworth as a clich√©d movie hero, something Lee has avoided up until this point.

These are relatively minor complaints, however. Look, Lee is far from my favourite filmmaker. I really disliked _Malcolm X_ (1992), for example, probably his most celebrated film, and he has justifiably been accused of racism himself on multiple occasions. None of that, however, changes the fact that this is an hilarious, powerful, insightful, and frightening piece of work.

Vital filmmaking from an angry filmmaker.

These are the reviews of audiences, and critics; it‚Äôs hard to find someone that didn‚Äôt like this movie (unless you‚Äôre going to burrow through the Rotten Tomatoes audience reviews, in which case I‚Äôm sorry.)

The cast is packed with familiar faces: Lakeith Stanfield (as Cassius) who also happened to be in _Get Out_, Jermaine Fowler who had just finished work on CBS‚Äô _Superior Donuts_, Danny Glover from the _Lethal Weapon_ films, and Terry Crews.

This movie had stunningly beautiful cinematography, and colors inspired by Bruce Block. Which is quite impressive considering the director (and writer) is a rapper with no background in film. But that story, what in the hell did I watch?

If you had seen the trailer and decided you want to go see this movie, maybe see it, but be prepared when that trailer just goes out the window. There isn‚Äôt some shocker twist at the end, this is an entirely different story.

Don‚Äôt go in thinking this is going to be funny, know that it‚Äôs a horror film and it will scar you. Think _Get Out_, but much, much worse (in a good way).,Such a great level of surrealism. I love when the setting is completely believeable, normal people, who could easily be from our world, but their's is totally weird. One criticism I will give is the imperfections in the dubbing, normally not a big deal, but dubbing is so absolutely **vital** to the story of _Sorry to Bother You_ that it is hard to get past. It was still a very pleasant surprise though, one I recommend, and one I particularly commend the core cast's performance in.

_We can - and should - certainly begin pointing out that corporations are fundamentally illegitimate, and that they don't have to exist at all in their modern form.

A paean to the proletariat. A pro-union battle cry. An ideological evisceration of late capitalism. A deconstruction of corporate greed and the concomitant commercialisation of self-worth necessary to succeed. A critique of identity politics. An allegory of institutional racism in big business. A lampooning of Silicon Valley bro culture. _Sorry to Bother You_, the debut feature of writer/director Boots Riley, is all this, and more. Very much in the key of absurdist fiction such as Dino Buzzati's _Il deserto dei Tartari_ (1940) and Ralph Ellison's _Invisible Man_ (1952), as well as race-conscious satirical cinema such as Robert Downey Sr.'s _Putney Swope_ (1969) and Melvin Van Peebles's _Watermelon Man_ (1970), whilst drawing more direct inspiration from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's _Faust_ (c.1806-1831), Alex Cox's _Repo Man_ (1984), and the work of Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and, bizarrely, Ken Loach, _Sorry to Bother You_ is a black comedy/Juvenalian satire/science fiction/horror/magic realist/allegorical character study. In short, it's impossible to classify. Dealing with the obstacles facing African Americans in a white-dominated corporate _milieu_, and positing that the experience of workers is determined by both labour conditions and race, the film examines labour relations, wage issues, worker solidarity, unionism, mass media, and the dangers of betraying oneself and choosing corporate advancement over friendships, relationships, and personal integrity. Although it's a beat or two too long, and although the spectacularly bizarre left-turn at the end of the second act will surely alienate a lot of viewers, the deconstruction and comic appropriation of code-switching results in a film that is constantly inventive, highly confrontational, and extremely funny.

Set in Oakland, California in an ""alternate present"", the company WorryFree offers food and lodging in exchange for a lifetime labour contract with no wages, a practice which the Supreme Court has deemed legal and not equivalent to slavery. Standing against WorryFree is the radical group ""Left Eye"", who organise protests and vandalise WorryFree's billboards. Unconcerned with any of this is Cassius ""Cash"" Green (LaKeith Stanfield), who lives in his uncle Sergio's (Terry Crews) garage with his girlfriend, Detroit (Tessa Thompson), a performance artist and, unbeknownst to Cash, a member of Left Eye. Struggling to pay rent, and with Sergio close to losing the house, Cash gets a job at the telemarketing firm RegalView, selling encyclopaedia sets. Initially finding it difficult to make any sales, Cash's luck changes when an older co-worker, Langston (Danny Glover), explains that he must use his ""_white voice_"" to be in any way successful. Proving adept at doing so, Cash quickly rises to become one of RegalView's elite ""Power Callers."" Meanwhile, a co-worker, Squeeze (Steven Yeun), forms a union and recruits Cash, Detroit, and their friend Salvador (Jermaine Fowler). Despite participating in an organised protest, Cash is surprised to get promoted. Now working in the luxurious upstairs suite, where he's mentored by Mr. _______ (a hilarious Omari Hardwick), Cash learns that RegalView is secretly selling human labour to WorryFree. Despite his misgivings, he is earning a substantial wage, and soon finds himself torn between his career and the labour movement. This is exacerbated when WorryFree CEO Steve Lift (a spectacular Armie Hammer) offers him a salary of $1 million a year to work directly for WorryFree. However, Cash then makes a discovery that changes everything, not just for himself, but potentially for all of humanity.

Riley, who identifies as a communist (but not a Marxist), is best known (thus far) as the lead vocalist of the far-left hip-hop groups The Coup and Sweet Sweeper Social Club. His father, Walter, was a political activist, joining the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in the '50s, and helping to organise the Greensboro sit-ins in 1960, protesting racial segregation in Woolworths and spearheading the Civil Rights' sit-in movement. Later, he joined CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], and the PLP [Progressive Labor Party]. Riley himself joined the PLP when he was 14, but left when he was 20, subsequently becoming a prominent member of the Occupy Movement in Oakland, and playing a key role in the 15 October 2011 global protests. The screenplay for _Sorry to Bother You_ was inspired by Riley's time working as a telemarketer, and the necessity of altering his voice so as to hide his ethnicity. The script was completed in 2012, but he had no means to make it. Instead, The Coup recorded an album of the same name, based on the script. Of the album, Riley told _The Chicago Tribune_, it talks

> _about the same stuff I'm always talking about. Capital and labour; racial inequality; organising the masses against a caste system of privilege; that sort of thing._

Words which are very applicable to the film. The script was then published in Timothy McSweeney's _Quarterly Concern_ in 2014, and Riley was subsequently invited to the Sundance Institute development labs to hone it further.

At its heart, _Sorry to Bother You_ is an anti-corporate, proletarian rally cry, something with which Riley has been engaged for decades; just listen to ""Fat Cats, Bigga Fish"" from _Genocide & Juice_ (1994), ""5 million ways to kill a C.E.O."" from _Party Music_ (2001), or ""My Favorite Mutiny"" from _Pick a Bigger Weapon_ (2006). In relation to this, Riley tells DemocracyNow,

> _the Taft-Hartely make it so you can't do solidarity strikes. And the reason why they make it so you can't do solidarity strikes is because they're effective. And so, we need a labour movement that's going to break those laws, because the laws that exist make the current ways of organising unions much harder. So, [the film] is almost also a call out to folks that consider theirself radicals._

Similarly, he explains to Hot97,

> _we need to have movements that can actually shut down industries in order to get what we want._

However, unlike Sam Levinson's recent satire _Assassination Nation_, _Sorry to Bother You_ is not especially interested in politics _per se_, certainly not in the explicit sense of films such as Sergei M. Eisenstein's _Stachka_ (1925), Haskell Wexler's _Medium Cool_ (1969), or Warren Beatty's _Bulworth_ (1998). This is not to say that the film ignores politics completely, rather it approaches the subject obliquely. For example, the country's most popular TV show, _I Got the Shit Kicked Out of Me_, involves people being violently assaulted by family and friends and then dunked in a vat of faeces, with Riley providing little to no contextualisation (think _It's Not My Problem!_ from Paul Verhoeven's _Robocop_ (1987), where Bixby Snyder's (S.D. Nemeth) catchphrase, ""I'd buy that for a dollar"", is used as a one-size-fits-all response to every situation). This mindless consumption of meaningless and morally questionable content indicates the passivity of the masses, their critical faculties either dormant or absent entirely (an inverse _verfremdungseffekt_, if you will). Clips of the show feature prominently throughout the film, allowing Riley to depict a _milieu_ where popular entertainment has reached an unimaginable low. Another example of a pseudo-political aspect of the film are the ubiquitous billboards and TV commercials advertising WorryFree, suggesting the corruption or co-opting of mass media. Additionally, Left Eye clearly recalls Antifa.

However, in relation to the most obvious political target for a film of this ilk, Trump's presidency, Riley has explicitly stated it is not an attack on Trump. Indeed, he wrote the script during the Obama administration, before Trump had even announced his candidacy. To ensure that the audience wouldn't think the film's invective was aimed at Trump, Riley made some changes after the election, such as removing a line where Mr. _______ says, ""_WorryFree is making America great again_"". On this pseudo-prescience, Riley tells the _LA Times_,

> _there are so many things in this movie that, when I wrote them, hadn't happened yet [...] The reason that these things are becoming more and more clear to us now is because it's connected to our economic system, not just connected to who's in elected office._

As this suggests, Riley's focus is very much on economic issues, with a lot of the humour derived from pecuniary-based situations. One of the easiest ways to parse the film is to approach it as a parable about selling out, equal parts polemic and acknowledgement that it's next to impossible _not_ to sell out in some way. Indeed, the last act of the film explicitly deals with the literal dehumanisation of the workforce (and I do mean ""literal"" ‚Äì to say any more would be a spoiler). RegalView and WorryFree exist in an economic system built upon impoverishing the many for the benefit of the few, with Riley attempting to expose the importance of a poverty line for the continued functioning of late capitalism. Within such a system, he suggests, it is exceptionally difficult for African Americans to succeed unless they are willing to code-switch. In this sense, although the concept of ""_white voice_"" does have a practical function within the narrative, its most salient characteristic is as an object of allegorical satire, a hyperbolic caricature of what African Americans need to do to survive in the Caucasian bro-culture corporate ranks of Silicon Valley; they must literally relinquish part of the self and pretend to be something Other. Speaking to DemocracyNow, Riley explains,

> _the new capitalism is ""there is no capitalism here. What are you talking about?"" It's like, this is not a workplace, this is a bean bag room. And I'm not your boss, I'm your friend who tells you what to do."" And so, as opposed to the oil baron idea, these are the cool people that everyone loves._

This is represented most clearly in the film by Steve Lift.

Interestingly, however, it's not just at RegalView where white voice is necessary; in attempting to woo customers to her art exhibition, Detroit too employs white voice. However, unlike Cash or Mr. _______'s white voices (provided by David Cross and Patton Oswalt, respectively), Detroit's is not only white, it's also British (voiced by Lily James), a distortion not only of her ethnicity, but so too of her nationality. She uses this voice to convince customers to take her art seriously, suggesting that she feels if she spoke in her real voice, they would not do so.

The film also delights in fairly subtle and oftentimes semi-obscure intertextuality. For example, a pair of earrings worn by Detroit declares, ""Bury the rag deep in your face"". This is from the Bob Dylan song, ""The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol"" (1963), which is about a black barmaid who died after being assaulted by the 24-year-old William Zanzinger, from the wealthy Zanzinger tobacco farming family. Zanzinger was initially charged with murder, but this was later reduced to manslaughter and assault. He was found guilty by a three judge panel and sentenced to six months in prison, as well as a fine of $500. Elsewhere in _Sorry to Bother You_, during a piece of performance art in which she encourages the audience to throw mobile phones and balloons filled with lamb's blood at her, Detroit quotes from Michael Schultz's _The Last Dragon_ (1985), a martial arts movie produced by Motown founder Berry Gordy. Another example of intertextuality is that Mr. _______ dresses like King George (Robert DoQui) from Jack Hill's blaxploitation classic _Coffy_ (1973).

Aesthetically, the film adopts a visual style obviously influenced by Michel Gondry, and, to a lesser extent, Terry Gilliam. An especially interesting aesthetic device, as anyone who has seen the trailer can attest, is how white voice is handled ‚Äì rather than having the actors simply speak in a different voice, Riley instead has the white actors' voices overdubbed; when Salvador first hears Cash's white voice, he literally tells him ""_you sound overdubbed_"". However, the lip syncing is, presumably intentionally, far from perfect, with the voice not quite aligning with the actors' mouth movements. This throws the scenes ""off"" ever so slightly, creating an extra layer of surreality, and highlighting just how absurd the whole thing is, drawing attention to the lengths these people have to go to achieve real success. The fact that our culture places such value on ""correct"" intonation is, in and of itself, absurd, like an extreme version of the phone voice that pretty much everyone has, and by failing to perfectly sync white voice to black actor, Riley is able to deconstruct and draw attention to this absurdity.

The film's other big aesthetic innovation is having Cash plunge (not especially gracefully) into the living room of the people he calls, desk and all. Obviously, this draws attention to the level of intrusion with which most people greet telemarketers, but, at least in the early stages, it also highlights Cash's own discomfit at being the intruder, seen most clearly when he drops in on a couple having sex. This is an excellently-handled piece of visual shorthand, conveying Cash's internal process, without having him verbalise it at any point.

Also impressive is the acting. While the standout performances are definitely Hammer and Hardwick, Stanfield certainly holds his own, with his body-language providing a clinic of wordless performing. Early on in the film, he's hunched over and put-upon, his every movement seemingly uncomfortable, as if ill at ease in his own skin. Later on, however, after his promotion at RegalView, his physicality acquires a more easy nature, he carries himself more confidently, as if high-powered telemarketing has helped him to find himself, something which is, in the context of the whole, doubly ironic. And no matter how surreal things get (and trust me, they get very, _very_ surreal), the cast keep everything grounded, as if what they're experiencing at any given moment is the most natural thing in the world.

Of course, it isn't all perfect. The wildly unexpected plot twist at the end of the second act will be too much for some people (there were multiple walk-outs at the screening I attended). The film is also just a beat or two too long, and the bottom does fall out to an extent before it reaches its madcap _d√©nouement_. There's also a mid-credit scene that serves as a kind of epilogue that I'm led to believe was a re-shoot when test audiences found the initial ending too abrupt. For me, however, it doesn't entirely work, and I would have much preferred the original, somewhat darker, ending. Also, with so much satire and humour floating about, almost by definition, not every joke lands, However, the flip side to this is that when Riley's humour does hit the target, it's sublime ‚Äì Mr. _______ literally beep-denied a name, for example, or Cash's two-word rap being gleefully cheered by Lift's assembled yuppies.

_Sorry to Bother You_ is as timely and relevant as it is funny and irreverent, as progressive as it is radical, and as inventive as it is confident. Exploring the intersection between race and economics from a wholly satirical point-of-view, the film both condemns and sympathises with those who choose to sell-out in some way so as to climb the ladder of success. Now in his late-40s, Riley is a veteran political protestor, a Chomsky-literate agitator, who is here positing that the most significant divide in the US isn't between white and black, it's between those with money and those without. Suggesting that the desire to cross this divide can lead to a herd mentality, the film argues that the labour force must never forget their collective strength, and must never turn on one another, as in such a situation, management will use workers like horses. A hugely impressive debut, and it will be interesting to see what Riley tackles next.,","slavery,satire,blood,poverty,oakland california,telemarketer,telemarketing,human animal hybid,race relations,modern slavery,",27,36,"Boots Riley,"

There should be more films made that take place in the 90s. And they should all star Timothee Chalamet and Maika Monroe. They're electrifying in Hot Summer Nights. This film is a bit of a mess at first, tonally jarring, and feels like Scorsese/P.T.Anderson-lite at times. But if you're going to borrow, borrow from the greats. It has a great soundtrack and is surprisingly dark by the end, ending on a note both mysterious and melancholic. It's these surprising elements and a bit of depth that makes Hot Summer Nights a pleasant summer diversion.

- Whitney Houston speaking to Shaun Robinson; _Access Hollywood_ (November 17, 2011). This was Houston's final interview; 13 weeks later, she was dead.

I wasn't a huge fan of Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal's _Whitney: Can I Be Me_ (2017). The film was built on the foundation of never-before-seen backstage footage from Houston's World Tour 1999, but I felt the narrative was poorly constructed, jumping from her divorce from Bobby Brown in 2007 to her death in 2012 with very little detail on what happened in those five years. This had the effect of making the last part of the documentary feel rushed and incomplete. I went into it not knowing a huge amount about Whitney Houston (apart from the obvious bits and pieces that everyone knows), and I came out still not knowing a huge amount about her.

Written and directed by Kevin Macdonald (_One Day in September_; _Touching the Void_; _Marley_), Whitney covers almost identical terrain as Broomfield and Dolezal, with many of the same interviewees appearing in both films, and much of the same factual information presenting itself (Houston tried drugs long before becoming a celebrity; she was criticised as ""_acting white_"" and selling out her culture by many black people, and was booed at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards (where her single ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go"" was nominated for Best R&B/Urban Contemporary Single - Female""); she was hounded with questions regarding her sexuality for much of her life, etc). One hugely important absence from both films, of course, is Robyn Crawford, Whitney's one time best friend, road manager, and probable lover, who was pretty much the only person in Houston's life who seemed to tell her what was what and have her best interests at heart. Apart from a beautiful obituary for _Esquire_ (on whose editorial staff Crawford's wife works), Crawford has maintained a dignified silence since Houston died, and neither Broomfield and Dolezal nor Macdonald were able to persuade her to speak on camera. This leaves a sizeable lacuna in the narratives of both films, as it is fairly unlikely anyone will really get to the core of who Houston was until (or indeed if) Crawford decides to tell her own story. As a side note, one interesting figure who didn't appear in _Can I Be Me_, but who does unexpectedly pop up in _Whitney_ is Clive Davis, president of Arista Records, and the man who signed Houston to her first record deal.

For all their similarities, however, I found Macdonald's film superior to _Can I Be Me_. _Whitney_ has two major, and interconnected, advantages over the earlier film. Can I Be Me is more concerned with facts, and probably covers more ""Did you know"" moments, such as the idea to open ""I Will Always Love You"" capella style was actually Kevin Costner's. However, having said that, Macdonald does manage to squeeze in a couple of not especially well known moments of his own; for example, Houston's haunting rendition of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" at the 1991 Super Bowl (where she had her bandleader and arranger Rickey Minor take the radical step of altering the time signature from a 3/4 to a 4/4) was completely unrehearsed, and the revelations regarding Dee Dee Warwick are shocking to say the least. However, what Macdonald does much better than Broomfield and Dolezal is that, on several occasions, he takes time out from the narrative to simply let the audience hear her sing. Probably because of this, his film is considerably more emotive. I was very moved by it on a couple of occasions; I don't remember being moved by _Can I Be Me_ at all. One scene in particular I found very upsetting recalls that horrific scene in Asif Kapadia's _Amy_ (2015), where Amy Winehouse is performing in Serbia a month before she died. In _Whitney_, it's footage from her Nothing But Love World Tour 2010, as she tries and completely fails to sing ""I Will Always Love You"" in Newcastle. The crowd is respectful enough, but given that so much of the documentary is simply about her voice, seeing her like this is very sad, as with her hoarse voice, she can barely stay in tune, let alone hit the high notes, sounding more like someone doing a bad karaoke rendition than one of the greatest singers of all time.

Another very well handled part of the documentary's narrative is its coverage of what could be termed ""mainstream media complicity"" in her suffering. Look, Whitney Houston was a drug addict and a terrible mother, who was indirectly responsible for Bobbi Kristina Brown's death, insofar as she gave her child no stability, and introduced her to a world of substance abuse. Nobody is arguing anything different. But she was also a person, suffering deeply, in public, and very few people did, or even tried to do, anything to help her. The film presents a 2002 sketch from _Saturday Night Live_ with Maya Rudolph as Whitney, in which she addresses the infamous Diane Sawyer ""_crack is whack_"" interview, and a scene from a 2005 episode of _American Dad!_, in which an emaciated Whitney ""sings for crack"" in the Smith living-room. These clips were probably funny at the time, but aren't especially funny now, and they serve to highlight one of the most bizarre paradoxes of our celebrity-obsessed society; we love to build people up and up and up, but, at some arbitrary point in time, we decide they've become too popular, too successful, too talented, so we do anything to pull them down, and when something goes wrong in their lives, really catastrophically wrong, our response as a society is not empathy, kindness, or understanding, but scorn, derision, and sarcasm.

- Catherine Corless; Receiving the Bar of Ireland's Human Rights Award, October 2017

Taking its inspiration from the history of Magdalene Laundries in Ireland, specifically the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, Aislinn Clarke's laudable debut feature, _The Devil's Doorway_, is a found-footage horror film. It undeniably has its share of clich√©s, but overall it's an impressive piece of work, dealing in an interesting manner with a truly shameful part of Irish history.

Ireland, 1960. Father Thomas Riley (a brilliant Lalor Roddy) and Father John Thornton (Ciaran Flynn) have been dispatched by the Vatican to a (non-specific) Magdalene Laundry to investigate a possible miracle. Sometime previously, the bishop received an anonymous letter from someone in the laundry claiming that one of the statues of Mary is bleeding from the eyes. True to their biblical namesakes, ""Doubting Thomas"" (as John calls him) is a sceptic, the Vatican's go-to guy when they want to debunk something (by his own admission, he has never seen a true miracle). World-weary and disillusioned, he is the polar opposite of the young and enthusiastic John. Straight from the seminary, John believes blindly in the institution of the Catholic Church, much to Thomas's disdain. Determined to catalogue everything they do, the first 20 minutes of the film mainly involve John getting in people's way and being told to turn off the camera, with Thomas repeatedly pointing out, ""_this is a waste of your film_"". Although Thomas is determined to find the ""_trickster_"" behind the bleeding statue, his initial focus is the manner in which the girls in the laundry are being treated by the nuns (in one especially powerful scene, he incredulously asks John, ""_do you really believe that Our Lady is here? In this place?_""). Because of this, he immediately butts heads with the rigid Mother Superior (an excellent Helena Bereen channelling Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched, and then some). However, with Thomas's focus on the girls, John comes to feel that something supernatural is happening ‚Äì he hears, and later sees, bedraggled children playing in the corridors, despite there being no children in the institution; handprints appear on his window; strange sounds emanate from the bowels of the laundry. Testing the blood from the statue, Thomas determines its type, and that it came from a pregnant woman. Initially testing all the laundry girls, none match, and so, to Mother Superior's disgust, he widens the search to include the nuns. However, he again fails to find a match. He and John then learn of Kathleen (Lauren Coe), a young pregnant girl kept chained in a padded room in the basement. Temporarily putting aside the fact that she can speak ancient Greek and seems to know a lot about Thomas's history, he is horrified with her treatment, demanding she receive proper medical attention. A doctor is summoned and upon examining her, he is stunned to learn that although Kathleen is pregnant, she is still a virgin. Then things get really weird.

Firstly, a bit of background. Usually run by Catholic orders, the first laundry in Ireland, the Dublin Magdalen Asylum, was actually a Protestant institution, and was opened in 1765 by Lady Arabella Denny. In 1996, the Monastery of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge, on Dublin's Sean McDermott Street, closed its doors, the last laundry to do so. In this 231 year period, it is estimated that upwards of 30,000 ""fallen women"" were confined in these prisons in-all-but-name, with over 10,000 imprisoned since Ireland's independence in 1922. The women confined there were sex workers, orphans, victims of rape and child abuse, the mentally ill, young girls considered too flirtatious or beautiful, and those who became pregnant out of wedlock. Essentially used as an unpaid slave labour force, the women spent their days washing sheets (which also serves as a metaphor for the Church's attitude to the laundries ‚Äì the women were penitently washing their ""sins"" away). They were physically and psychologically abused by the nuns and exploited by the Church, which was fully aware of what was happening behind closed doors. Of course, it's not just that these women were locked away and mistreated ‚Äì it's that they were forcefully separated from any children they may have had, many of whom were illegally sold to wealthy American families.

In 1993, the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge sold part of their convent, St. Mary's Refuge, in the Drumcondra suburb of Dublin. The property developer who purchased the land subsequently discovered an unmarked mass grave holding 155 bodies of women and children. Although the Sisters attempted to cover it up, the media soon found a litany of abuses perpetrated in institutions up and down the country. This led to the 1997 Channel 4 documentary _Sex in a Cold Climate_ and the 1999 RT√â documentary series _States of Fear_. It was later discovered that the Irish Army, √Åras an Uachtar√°in, Guinness, Clerys, the Gaiety Theatre, Dr Steevens' Hospital, the Bank of Ireland, the Department of Defence, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, CI√â, Hasbro, and multiple hotels and golf clubs across the country all had contracts with what were referred to as ""institutionalised laundries"". Indeed, so widely used were these laundries that during the 1940s, the Irish government noted that commercial laundries were letting significant numbers of staff go, as so many businesses were using the cheaper ""institutionalised laundries"".

In February 2013, Taoiseach Enda Kenny issued a formal apology to the Magdalene Survivors, calling the laundries the ""_nation's shame_"". A few days later, two nuns gave an interview on RT√â Radio 1 under condition of anonymity. Arguing that the media coverage was a ""_one-sided anti-Catholic forum_"", they refused to apologise to the Survivors, asking,

>_apologise for what? Apologise for providing a service? We provided a free service for the country._

In July, Bill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League in the United States, claimed,

> _there was no holocaust, and there was no gulag. No one was murdered. No one was imprisoned, nor forced against her will to stay. There was no slave labour. Not a single woman was sexually abused by a nun. Not one. It's all a lie._

In August, the Irish government set up a ‚Ç¨50 million compensation scheme for the Survivors. However, as of 2018, the four religious groups who operated the majority of the laundries (the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, the Religious Sisters of Charity, and the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge), have refused all demands from the Irish government, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and the UN Committee Against Torture to contribute to the compensation fund.

It's difficult for an Irish person to even speak about this without becoming angry, as it's one of the darkest chapters of our history, and, along with the revelations regarding state and Church-sanctioned clerical sex abuse, it is the reason why 21st century Ireland has roundly rejected the Catholic Church, an institution which once lorded over every aspect of the country, telling people how to act, what to say, what to think. To give an example of how much the country has repudiated the Church, when Pope John Paul II visited Ireland in 1979, roughly 2,700,000 people came to see him (just shy of half the population of the country). When Pope Francis came in 2018, attendance was less than 130,000.

In the vile Magdalene Laundry history, perhaps the most significant scandal was that of the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway. Opened in a converted workhouse in 1925 and known to locals simply as ""The Home"", it was run by the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours, and catered mainly to unwed pregnant women, who were sent there to give birth. It closed in 1961, but in 2012, a social worker discovered documentation related to over 1,000 babies sent to the United States for illegal adoption. The Health Service Executive soon discovered that The Home had often contacted parents asking for money for the upkeep of children who had already been shipped to the US. Speculating that the discovery could ""_prove to be a scandal that dwarfs other, more recent issues with the Church and State_"", the HSE recommended that then Minister for Health, James Reilly be informed, and a full enquiry launched. However, Reilly was never told, and the details of the HSE report were not made public until the _Irish Examiner_ published a special investigation in 2015. Meanwhile, also in 2012, but unrelated to the HSE enquiries, local Tuam historian Catherine Corless began an investigation into The Home. In 2013, she retrieved the names of 796 children whose deaths were registered there. Cross-referencing the names with local graveyards, however, Corless discovered that only two of the 796 had been formally buried. In 2014, a mass grave was discovered at the site of The Home's septic tank, with the site unmarked and not registered as a burial ground with local authorities. Initial excavations in 2016 and 2017 found that all of the skeletons were between 35 foetal weeks and three-years-old, with most carbon dated to between 1925 and 1950. As of October 2018, a full excavation is planned, and the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation is continuing its enquiries.

One might think that nothing more horrific could be made of this subject than the actual facts of the case; after all, Peter Mullan's superb, but exceptionally disturbing, _The Magdalene Sisters_ (2002) is a horror film in everything but name. However, what Clarke and her co-writers, Martin Brennan and Michael B. Jackson, do in _The Devil's Doorway_ is use the very real issues as the foundation for a socially conscious horror film which serves as a conduit for the anger felt throughout the country. In a Q&A after the film screened at Dublin's 2018 Horrorthon Festival, Clarke explained that the decision to make a horror movie about something so serious and important to the nation was because, ""_horror is good at unpacking social trauma_"", allowing a filmmaker ""_to metaphorically explore national pain_."" Far more concerned with the shifting moral positions of the two priests than it is with devils and demons or silly jump scares (although there are a few of these), the film thus functions as a kind of microcosmic allegory of Irish history; John represents Ireland of the 1960s, innocent and blindly faithful, unwilling to believe anything negative about the Church, whilst Thomas represents the Ireland of today, jaded and disillusioned, spiritually cut off from ecclesiastical doctrine, scathing of Church dogma, and all too aware of the earthly sins committed in the name of Catholicism.

Reading between the lines of the horror tropes, this is a film about _human_ evil ‚Äì the primary story is not the investigation into the statues or Kathleen's possible possession, it's the discovery that the institution has been discarding the bodies of dead children in a vast underground catacomb, with the full knowledge of the Holy See. Clarke, an atheist herself, is thus far more interested in showing the hypocrisy of the Church's culpability, condoning the torture of woman and the unsanctified burial of children, whilst it preached morality to the masses, warning of the esoteric dangers of contraception, the evils of homosexuality, and the iniquity of blasphemy. In her view, the evils perpetrated by the nuns against defenceless children are far more horrific and disturbing than anything a demon could unleash on the world. Speaking to Indiewire, she calls the film

>_a comment on the potential for a church-state to become somewhere where evil happens and evil can be nurtured._

Looking at issues such as the illogicality of blind faith and the history of organised religions' tendency to marginalise women, often to the point of violating their human rights, Clarke exposes the Catholic Church's duplicity, laying bare their utterly contemptible and self-serving role in Irish history, and it's the anger and sincerity of this message that lingers far longer than any of the film's genre elements. The sympathy Clarke feels for these women and children is palpable throughout. Indeed, in 1997, Clarke herself had a son out of wedlock at age 17, and under different circumstances, could have ended up in a laundry. Thus, the film is intensely personal, as the entire Magdalene scandal should be for all Irish people over the age of 20.

One of the film's greatest strengths is Lalor Roddy's performance as Thomas. Playing the priest as cynical and disheartened, worn down by years of debunking claims of miracles, at least initially, he is far more interested in the treatment of the girls than the possibility that the statue's bleeding may be authentic. He's also no shill for the church, seen in lines such as, ""_this place disgusts me. The people who run this place disgust me_,"" or when he describes Giuseppe Verdi's letter to Pope Pius XI asking for special dispensation to allow female singers to perform the _Messa da Requiem_ (1874). As the film goes on, Thomas becomes more and more angry about what is happening in the laundry, leading to one of the most thematically relevant and narratively justified f-bombs I've ever heard in a film. One of the film's primary themes is the hypocrisy of the Church, and the ugliness of organised religion in general, and this theme is carried primarily by Thomas. Roddy's layered interpretation of Thomas's existential crisis is the primary reason the film works so well in an emotional sense. Painfully aware that acceptance of dogma, faith in the Church, and belief in God are three very different things, Thomas finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile his genuine love for God with the practices the Church carry out in His name, with Roddy's performance adding a great deal of both emotional and esoteric complexity to the film.

Thomas isn't the only character to voice criticisms of the Church, however. In perhaps the film's key scene, when Thomas threatens to reveal to the bishop what's happening at the laundry, the Mother Superior laughs, telling him he'd be surprised to learn how unsurprised the bishop is. She then launches her own attack on the Church, arguing that the nuns are used to do the Church's dirty work, with insufficient resources, and, when things go wrong, they must take the blame. An especially good line in this scene concerns the pregnancy of the women in the laundry, with Mother Superior rhetorically asking Thomas, ""_Do you know how many of the babies born here had fathers who were Fathers, Father?_"" Although a contemplable character, everything she says in this scene is relevant and pertinent to Clarke's overall message.

At Horrorthon 2018, Clarke was asked if there were any concerns regarding accusations of exploitation during the making of the film. She acknowledged there were, explaining that she remained very much aware during filming that many people who lived in the laundries are still alive today, and that maintaining the integrity of the women and children was paramount on her mind at all times. Speaking to Indiewire, she further explained,

>_there are women who are only 40 today who have been in these laundries, so I did worry that there might be people who have trauma from these places that would instantly feel that they were being attacked or they were being exploited by the fact that I even made a horror film with these elements._

However, at Horrorthon, she also said she had heard from several Magdalene Survivors who had loved the film, and one woman in particular who travelled from Cork to Belfast to view it, giving an emotional endorsement when it was finished. Indeed, Clarke explained that the film was originally written to be set in 2018, with a group of urban explorers running afoul of eerie goings-on in an abandoned laundry, and it was only when she came on-board that it was relocated to the 1960s. She chose this period because it was during the 60s that the laundries were at the height of their powers. Believing that setting the film in 2018 and depicting urban explorers would have been disrespectful and exploitative (calling to mind Bradley Patrick's disgusting 2012 film, _Chernobyl Diaries_), Clarke felt that to relocate it to 1960 lent it an air of authenticity, whilst also allowing her to deal head-on with the moral issues thrown up by the scandal.

Aesthetically, the film is also interesting, managing to sidestep many of the inherent problems with found-footage films. For example, the fact that it's set in 1960 means it's shot on 16mm rather than VHS or hi-def. The 1.37:1 Academy Ratio, complete with rounded corners, has the effect of making director of photography Ryan Kernaghan's carefully composed images look like historic photographs. The shaky and imperfect footage also gives the film a sense of an old _cin√©ma v√©rit√©_-style documentary, with the amount of artefacts helping to sell the first-person immediacy of the cinematography ‚Äì lens flares and burn-outs are especially common, and the handheld nature of the filming has a suitably disorienting effect. Granted, John's Bolex camera manages to pick up far more detail in dark locations than would be possible with only a single bulb as illumination, but this is a relatively minor gripe when the overall look is so good. This point also nicely illustrates the avoidance of another pitfall of found-footage horror films ‚Äì why the hell don't they drop the camera and get out of Dodge. A problem in many such films, here, the answer is simple ‚Äì in many scenes, the camera is providing the only source of light, hence why John keeps it turned on and filming.

Also worthy of praise is the sound design, which, as with the cinematography, manages to avoid a bugbear of found-footage films ‚Äì pitch-perfect sound irrespective of location and people's distance from the camera. Here, there are multiple examples of dialogue being muffled when spoken away from camera. It's a very simple touch, but it adds a nice air of verisimilitude to proceedings.

Of course, the film isn't perfect. As the latest in a long line of found-footage exorcism/possession horror movies (including, off the top of my head, Daniel Stamm's _The Last Exorcism_, William Brent Bell's _The Devil Inside_, David Jung's _The Possession of Michael King_, and Mark Neveldine's _The Vatican Tapes_, the crowded nature of the subgenre, and the general lack of quality of the films, doesn't do it any favours. Additionally, especially as it nears its climax, it regurgitates a number of genre clich√©s ‚Äì floating beds, upside down crucifixes, scary nuns, creepy kids, creepy dolls, skeletons, underground caverns, jump scares which don't make a great deal of practical sense etc. Falling back a little too much on the generic conventions it has managed to avoid until the last half hour or so, in this sense, the film ultimately plays it disappointingly safe.

However, all things considered, this is an excellent piece of work, and an extremely accomplished debut. It looks amazing, and is far better than the majority of found-footage movies, arguably the best such film since Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S√°nchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999). The acting is terrific, and it's properly creepy in places. Perhaps most importantly, however, if you can look past the hokum and the genre markers, you'll find a socially conscious film engaging with a painful national scandal through which we are all still living.,<I>Evil is in all of us.</I>

This movie is decent in the way of story and pacing. However, the found footage techniques and cliches used in horror movies before this are definitely noticeable.

This won't wow horror and found footage fans, but it will give you some entertaining moments with Reverend Mother (aka Mother Superior) conversations with Father Thomas.

This film could've packed more spooks into it overall. But i'm sure the budget didn't make it happen.,","nun,asylum,possession,priest,possessed,ireland,demon,found footage,pregnant girl,",12,22,"Aislinn Clarke,"

The sole rightful heir of a Scandinavian kingdom (Anna Demetriou) is unjustly exiled and must survive the unforgiving wilderness while figuring out a way to win back her father‚Äôs throne.

""Viking Destiny"" (2018) may be low-budget, but it‚Äôs superb for what it is: A simple heroic fantasy flick with a compelling story that flows, great Irish locations, colorful cinematography & costumes, an effective score, a quality cast, and a runtime that doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome (the credits start rolling at 84 minutes). I‚Äôm assuming the events take place during the Viking era, 793‚Äì1066 AD. In any case, Anna Demetriou is both beautiful and convincing as the Viking princess, a thoroughly worthy protagonist.

The budget is comparable to similar low-cost flicks like ‚ÄúThe Viking Queen‚Äù (1967) and ‚ÄúThe Lost Future‚Äù (2010), but with the modern production sheen of quality sword & sandal TV series‚Äô, like Vikings, but more colorful and less dismal & brooding. Nevertheless, there are several bits o‚Äô wisdom to mine. If you like movies like ‚ÄúTristan + Isolde‚Äù (2006), ‚ÄúThe Vikings‚Äù (1958), the aforementioned ‚ÄúThe Lost Future,‚Äù ‚ÄúConan the Barbarian‚Äù (1982) or any of the D&D pictures, I guarantee you‚Äôll find a lot to appreciate here.

There‚Äôs one story issue that might turn-off some viewers and that‚Äôs the idea that a couple of Norse Gods appear to the protagonists and antagonists. But it‚Äôs explained that only the person in question can ‚Äúsee‚Äù these gods, whether Odin or Loki. It might help to accept this on the grounds that people in the modern day are motivated through God or the devil & evil spirits (or however you want to put it). The character of the individual determines which ones from which they receive.

The film runs 1 hour, 91 minutes and was shot in Northern Ireland. The action gets pretty brutal and there‚Äôs one overt sex scene in the forest.

Only the last offers a clue to interpreting the movie‚Äôs more astonishing revelations and unprobed corners. Until then, Matt Tyrnauer‚Äôs gossipy portrait of Scotty Bowers, an impish nonagenarian and former Marine, listens without judgment as he describes decades of servicing the closeted hungers of stars like Rock Hudson and Katharine Hepburn, helped by an eager network of World War II buddies.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._,_**Eight people on a luxury yacht, but there‚Äôs another passenger**_

In the Strait of Georgia in the Vancouver area eight people, half of them strangers, end up on an unexpected ride in a luxury yacht where some of them eventually board a dinghy to the nearest island and horrific things happen. Will anyone make it back alive? Jesse Metcalfe plays the quasi-protagonist with a secret agenda. 
   
‚ÄúThe Ninth Passenger‚Äù (2018) is a drama/thriller with a little horror that brings to mind yacht/schooner movies like ""Dead Calm"" (1989) and ""Caught Inside"" (2010), but with a surprise twist in the last act, which has more to do with flicks like ‚ÄúFriday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan‚Äù (1989). 

While this is the least of these, it‚Äôs proficiently made for a low-budget film with a decent cast of no-names, fitting atmosphere, a quality score and impressive F/X. But the script needed more tweaking because there‚Äôs a lack of cohesion to the story. It‚Äôs like several ideas put together that needed a little more smoothness and logic. Yet it could also be argued that ambiguity works in the picture‚Äôs favor. 

Metcalfe does well as the formidable protagonist, inspiring men to get in better shape. As for the feminine cast, there are four beauties: Alexia Fast (Jess), Veronica Dunne (Christy), Sabina Gadecki (Tina) and Cinta Laura Kiehl (Nicole), but the director only milks the latter‚Äôs splendor (no nudity) and she‚Äôs debatably the least of ‚Äôem.

This had the immediate potential to be great and they immediately down played it as something that happened instead of the proper plot of the story.

This is all jumbled up ""Pulp Fiction"" style, but without big celebrities to make the parts seem more important.  The (traditional) 1st act of the story is cut up and dispersed throughout the movie as if to slowly justify how she was put in this position in the first place which causes a very drawn out 2nd act of dealing with the situation, and what feels like a very rushed 3rd act of resolution.

Thinking back on it, I don't even remember how it ended.....hold on...*rewatch ending*, oh yeah, I just didn't remember that as the end of the movie, probably because they cut back to a different scene afterward.

I understand that they wanted to do something different, but they took a great concept and a really good execution and reduced to Really Good at best, and I'm sure there are people that don't care about the psychology of the characters or enough about writing to appreciate what the movie actually shows, but I think if you have an open mind, there is plenty to like about this one.,",,17,4,"Jessica Manafort,"
