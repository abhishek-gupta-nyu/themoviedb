The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we’ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don’t know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you’ll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn’t the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a “Marvel”ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would’ve been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would’ve been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn’t overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn’t make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you’ll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn’t overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody. I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse a 10/10.,It's true I liked it less than perhaps the vast majority of _Spider-Verse's_ audience, but this was still great, the animation enamouring, and the depth of its story and reference totally engaging. Not to me the best Spider-Man movie as many have said, (that honour still goes to _Homecoming_) but a blast all the same.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,My wife doesn’t care for Spider-Man at all - as Batman is her favorite superhero.

With that being said, she loves this movie to death, along with my son and I. It’s safe to say we’ve watched this movie over 10 times and we’ve shown it to all our friends. It’s a really great movie that promotes diversity, good animation, and has a great story. I highly recommend to all who are interested in watching.,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) is no ordinary Spider-Man movie, it contains multiple characters with the same powers in multiple dimensions.
 This is also not an ordinary animated movie. It has animated style we have never seen before. There were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. Nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. However, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. They don't make it realistic or cartoon. The creators used an old-school technique called ""smear"". If you look in a single frame, you'll notice things like multiple limbs to create the illusion of movement. Basically, the entire movie was a comic book that moves. There is a technique in half-toning, which uses dots to create colors and gradients. They were really jaw-dropping. The shadows were created with hatching or crisscrossed lines. The movie had some textures so it would be exactly like a comic and I was glad that it deserved Oscars's Best Animated Feature. All of these techniques combined to make a movie that was the best animated feature not just in 2018 but perhaps of all time. It was really like a masterpiece of animation!
 The story plot was really good. The scenes were quite EPIC and sometimes tragic and hilarious. The unbelievable thing was when Peter Parker died in Miles' Dimension. It was really sad to see an iconic superhero killed by a supervillain. The deaths are moving and the hilarious scenes kept me laugh a lot. I like the end-credits when it started in the Animated Tv Show Spider-Man (1966) when the two Spider-Men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was Spider-Man pointing to Spider-Man 2099. How did they do that? Perhaps the best moment to me was “A Leap of Faith” when Miles tried to be the one and only Spider-Man in his dimension, after Peter Parker was dead.
I wasn't bored watching this movie, it kept my eyes open on the screen looking at the newest kind of animation. I was totally impressed! Perhaps this is the greatest animated movie of alll time! It was a really good idea to release this on Christmas!,Stan Lee would be proud! Great story, great message, and great animation.,It's easy to see how this became the visual masterpiece it is. The creators put a lot of love and passion into its making and the results are amazing!,I was asleep most of the time while watching this film,  but during the times I was awake, I enjoyed the animation and it looked like something I would've enjoyed - if I weren't too busy dozing off.,I didn't expect I would enjoy this movie this much. The trailers looked too hyped for me and so I thought it would flop just like the other ones. Surprisingly, it didn't and I had my eyes glued to the screen because of the awesome animation the creators put out. Really good job!,Spider-Man has always been that character that I saw in live-action movies so to see him in an animated version was a first for me. It was hard for me to enjoy it at first but the movie didn't seem too bad and had a really good plot.,At first,  I expected I was gonna be disappointed because all of the trailers for this Spider-Man looked childish and too millennial for me. And being a fan of the Tobey Spider-Man, I had high expectations. Surprisingly though, I was able to still love the film!,No doubt about it. This is truly Marvel, from the bold storytelling all the way to its stylish animations.,A lot of risks were taken in this video and all that paid off giving us one hell of a film!,Although the story was a textbook plot, it still had enough twists to satisfy both new and returning audiences.,This definitely has Stan Lee's seal of approval. People in the studio, be proud of yourselves. You have made Stan Lee proud.,One of the few films that lived up to the hype and even surpassed my expectations.,Watched this movie a couple of times and I think it's safe to say that it's a near, perfect movie.,Animators really outdid themselves on this one by giving each character a uniqueness to them.,Sony really nails making character movement look detailed and pronounced.,Despite having a plot that's almost predictable, the visual style and the way it was presented made the film feel fresh.,The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, and characters are some of the best I've ever seen!,","superhero,based on comic,aftercreditsstinger,alternate universe,",74,189,"Bob Persichetti,"

Pictures,The Safran Company,Rodeo FX,Panoramic Pictures,DC Films,Cruel & Unusual Films,",Aquaman Collection,"en,","AU,US,",7,"Good movie to watch.,***Lame-axx butt of a joke no longer*** 

Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father on the Maine Coast, a caretaker of a lighthouse. With the mentorship of Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the revelations of Mera (Amber Heard) he discovers that he is the half-breed heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.

“Aquaman” (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It’s reminiscent of “Thor” (2011) and “Thor: The Dark World” (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make “Aquaman” ‘thrilling,’ but less compelling story-wise.

Still, it’s very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur’s mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public’s generally weak perception of Aquaman.

The film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).

GRADE: B,I just came back home from watching Aquaman on the IMAX theater in Balexert in Geneva and thought that I should write something up while it’s still fresh in my mind. Something that happens all too rarely.

I have to say that, overall, I had quite a blast watching this movie. It is indeed a good superhero and special effects extravaganza. In addition it is quite beautiful. A lot of the underwater scenes are very pleasing on the eye indeed. I am quite happy that I managed to drag my ass over to a theater and watch it on a IMAX screen. Some of the hype around it is perhaps a bit too much though. It does not quite reach the masterpiece level after all.

Storywise, well it is a superhero movie after all so if you expect the story to be profound, logical and watertight you should lay off those mushrooms or whatever you are smoking. That said, the story was not too bad. Pretty straightforward and not too convoluted. A good, solid story suitable for a action/adventure movie.

I did quite like the main protagonists on the good side. Especially Jason Momoa as Aquaman. I mean his time-to-kick-some-ass-stare was just so…evil. The script writer had put some stupid shit in there where he had to play overly dumb at times but on the whole he was a good guy throughout the entire movie. Almost no whining, angst and anti-hero shit like what have totally ruined most of the Marvel TV-shows lately.

The bad guys were not too bad either. Orm was lacking a bit in the bad guy charisma department but Black Manta was oozing despicable bad bad bad asshole from the first scene to the last. I probably should not say this because his weird helmet is indeed true to the comics but, well, it’s weird and kind of looks better in a comics than on the big screen.

Special effects? Well, there is not that much to say really. They are pretty awesome throughout the movie and, as I wrote above, a lot of the time they are also beautiful. The various creatures, underwater vehicles and gadgets are really cool and well designed.

The one gripe I have about the movie is the totally unnecessary green preaching crap. Luckily it is confined to a couple of scenes but in those it is really slapped in the audience’s faces. A superhero movie should be entertaining, not preaching. If I want that shit I can turn on the news. It’s a star off from me just for that nonsense.,Doesn't hold a candle to _Wonder Woman_, but tall-buildings worth of leaps (and bounds) better than everything else that's come out of the DCIThoughtSheWasWithU. It's weirdly kind of... The nicest? Of these movies? Which is not the kind of direction you would think a film in this series would go based on how it started, but Jason Momoa is just charismatic as **Hell**, and _Aquaman_ leans on that a lot.

By the time it's over, _Aquaman_ really does hit just about every cliche of the genre there is, which is not exactly high praise. It's certainly not without heart, but it is still more spectacle than substance. But unlike, say, your _Transformers 4_, a movie often levelled the same criticism, it is not trash.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._,Aquaman was soooo cool!!!,The story was laughable.
The plot holes were immense.
The dialogue was atrocious.
The special effects were technically competent and pretty but cartoonish and unbelievable.

Easily the worst film I've seen in the last year.

If it was a bit campy, then it might have succeeded in a kind of sub-Flash-Gordon fashion.,I am so conflicted.
We're introduced to the atlanteans with Nicole Kidman in a leotard and wet hair looking out of place in a living room and eating a gold fish.
The first fight scene has so many dramatic zoom-ins with dramatic music I thought I was watching the dramatic chipmunk video.
Willem Dafoe riding a fish!
Cheesy lines like a bad 80's action parody.
Some amazing CGI environments, others looked like they belonged in Diablo 3. Awful compositing throughout.
Unnecessary detour through the Mines of Moria.
Puzzles worthy of Lucas Arts point and click adventure games. A villain from 90s power rangers.
Amazing scary trench scene! Giant sea creature war with fireworks and laser beams!

Thus I was indeed a bit worried when I sat down to watch this one with the kids yesterday. After all there is really so many ways a incompetent writer could have screwed this one up. Especially one with an agenda.

Luckily this was not the case and I have to say that I quite liked this movie. Disney actually managed to keep the ambiance of the original movie and it actually felt like a Disney movie from the good old days. The days before every easily offended retard tried to make every movie into a preaching mouth piece for their personal crusade.

I think I liked the first half of the movie best. It was an explosion of song, magic and, for me, nostalgia. Apart from the hugely improved technology this movie had available to make the magic bits it actually felt like it could have been made back to back with the original. They really managed to capture the atmosphere from back then.

If I had to compare the two directly I would still go with the original as the best one. It was more imaginative and it just felt a bit better two me.

The story is a bit of a rehash of the original. They could have come up with something more original. Also, the second movie seemed to fizzle out a bit compared to the first half. I would have liked to see some more Mary Poppins coolness and magic, like we saw in the first half of the movie, instead of, mostly, conventional stuff. Also the take down of the bad guy was a bit underwhelming.

Apart from that I think sequel was not bad at all.,I enjoyed this movie just as I love the original Mary Poppins. I think it is largely a thankless task doing sequels for beloved films: Christopher Robin and Hook had to pass through a crucible of dislike by lovers of similar original flicks.  Remakes are similarly unpopular, perhaps for better reason, in my opinion. O 

The makers of Mary Poppins Returns aren't trying to reinvent the wheel, just entertain by using a bit of imagination to bring the original tale to a more savvy modern audience. No reason for us to rhetorically throw our toys out of the sandbox. Okay, I may not watch this new offering as often as I have the original, but it was entertaining without being rude, profane, crude or violent.

This is the third canon (or official if you’re not familiar with anime terms) Dragon Ball movie, after Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’. So, unless you kept up with the anime, this film isn’t for you. Just letting you know right off the bat.

I would love to be able to describe in words what Dragon Ball means to me, but I can’t. It’s impossible to create a sentence that seamlessly lets you know how nervously excited I was right before the movie started. Yesterday, it was my first time watching my favorite anime on the big screen, and oh my God, it was AWESOME! Finally, I watched a film that I was highly anticipating, and I actually enjoyed it. Finally! I was tired of expecting big things from movies I really wanted to become a huge success, just to get ultimately disappointed. Broly is everything I wished for and more. Nevertheless, I must advise you: this animated flick is NOT for a casual moviegoer! 

If you stopped following Dragon Ball after Z or you don’t even know what DB is, you’ll basically be lost. You won’t recognize certain characters, you won’t understand how and why some guys are still alive, and you’ll have no clue about how strong our warriors became. This is for the fans. I’ve seen critics bashing this film to shreds, and they start their reviews stating “I’ve never seen the anime.” Then why would you watch a movie that clearly follows the anime’s story and review it? Just leave it alone! It’s like watching Avengers: Endgame without ever watching a single one of the 21 previous installments. It’s just nonsensical. So, with that out of the way, and assuming I’m writing for fans of the anime … 

This is the best Dragon Ball film ever, by a long shot. Yes, the track record wasn’t that good to begin with, and most of the movies released aren’t even canon. Still, Battle of Gods and Resurrection ‘F’ were pretty great, especially the former. Broly easily surpasses these two, in almost every aspect. Of course, I need to be fair to those first films. Dragon Ball Super elevated the anime once again and brought it back to the mainstream, so obviously, Broly had a lot of advantages since the studios offered everything they could so that the movie would be a major success. When the first two films were released, Super didn’t exist yet. Basically, these first movies were trying to bring back Dragon Ball to life while Broly is all about keeping it alive and showing it still has tremendous potential.

Thankfully, it all worked out perfect. The box office results are mind-blowing which will surely guarantee the continuation of Super (I’m waiting every single day for the news of the series renewal), and the film is, in fact, astonishing. The animation quality is absolutely jaw-dropping. You know when you go with friends to watch a movie and something so awesome occurs that you just look at each other in awe of what just happened? That’s Broly every single minute from the moment the fight begins. Super gave the fans a glimpse of what the animation level could be if time was not an issue for the animators. The Tournament of Power arc is undeniable proof that when the production leaves the animators work with no pressure, the end result is outstanding.

It’s just so freaking awesome. This is the only word in the dictionary that can reflect how crazily good the animation is. Awesome. There are so many long sequences of choreographed fights, with the animation always on-point, and with exceptional editing. The aspect I love the most is probably how fast it all is. Finally, I can understand Krillin when he says “how are you following that?!” Everything flows in such a flawless style: the characters, the blasts, the environment, everything. The sound design is incredibly powerful, as well. From the get-go, you know you’ll feel every punch, kick, “Kamehameha” and “Galick Gun.” Goku, Vegeta, and Broly provide so many amazing action scenes, and I know I’ll constantly rewatch them once they become available. God, Super ended a year ago, and I still find myself watching the final fight with Jiren every week or so.

However, Dragon Ball isn’t about the fights. Yes, everyone loves them, and there are a lot of fans who only care about the actual moment when our heroes fight their enemies. As a hardcore fan of the saga, it’s so much more than that. If characters like Goku and Vegeta, but also Piccolo, Gohan or even Frieza didn’t exist, their battles wouldn’t have the same impact. They mean something because these characters are important to me. I care so much about them because they were beautifully-developed throughout hundreds of episodes. I know that fillers can be a bit boring, but for me, they were just another way of getting to know these characters. Give me twenty minutes of banter between Goku and Vegeta, and I’ll be the happiest man on Earth, right now.

I’ll put it this way: if you enjoyed Battle of Gods more than Resurrection ’F’, you will love DBS: Broly as much or more than I do. If it’s the other way around, the first half of this film might leave you a bit disappointed. If you’re one of those fans who only care about the fights, you can leave the first 45 minutes with barely any Goku or Vegeta to me and the other fans who care about the story. I heavily praise Akira Toriyama‘s screenplay. This is the big difference to the other non-canon movies: they weren’t written by someone who really understands the characters at their disposal. Toriyama knows exactly who Broly is, where he comes from, and how he lived through his young years.

He wonderfully flushes out Broly by giving him an emotionally captivating backstory, filled with parent abuse, violence, and isolation from the rest of the universe. The history of Saiyans and Planet Vegeta is (finally) told entirely, by showing us characters that we all know and love, but that we were never able to see for more than a few minutes. Nevertheless, the standout character of the film is Broly. He has more screentime than any of the other warriors, precisely due to the reason I mentioned above: for us to care about him. Truth is, when they start fighting, I don’t want anyone to win or lose, because I genuinely care about all of them. Toriyama wasted half of the movie to develop this “new” character, and I 100% support his decision. Not only it generates more build-up to the inevitable climax, but it offers more layers to it. It stopped being “just a fight.”

Obviously, there were going to be nods to the past adventures. I almost dropped a tear when Goku and Vegeta show up for the first time due to the soundtrack alone. You’ll love every single “flash” regarding previous moments of Dragon Ball history, including the latest series and arc. Toriyama also does a remarkable job in helping fans that never watched Super trying to understand what happened after Z, even if he didn’t need to. The comedy bits are hilarious, as they have been with the latest series. From Vegeta yelling at Goku for doing or saying something dumb, to Bulma‘s interactions with Beerus and Whis, every joke lands in one way or another.

As much as I love this film, it does have some issues regarding its mixing of CGI with animation. One of the things I didn’t like at all in Resurrection ‘F’ was how some sequences felt like a video game. Unfortunately, there are a couple of moments like that in Broly. In order to keep the scenes flow without any cuts, CGI is necessary so the camera can change to another angle, and sometimes there’s this feeling that you seem to be playing one of Dragon Ball games. However, my biggest gripe has to be with the overuse of visual effects. Using VFX to build rich environment and help the battles have more impact, not only doesn’t work well but it’s just not Dragon Ball.

As we reach the climax, the VFX overpower the animation, and that is never a good thing. The fight loses its animated essence, and it becomes something that I don’t even know how to describe, except that it isn’t what it was supposed to be. In addition to this, even though I stated that this movie is about Broly and Broly alone, I would have loved to see more from Frieza. He acts purely as a plot device, and there’s barely anything for him to actively do, but he’s still important to make the plot move forward. Finally, the pacing could have been more balanced. Since the ending is predictable from even before the fight begins, it feels that the film was a bit stretched to try to reach the two-hour runtime.

Also, if you’ve seen all the trailers, you basically know the entire movie. That’s why I keep advising my followers to stop watching trailers or at least all of them. If you really need visual confirmation that the film deserves your time and money, watch the first trailer and decide from there. Dragon Ball Super always gave spoiler-heavy previews of the next episode, and the movie literally shows everything. Even without watching a single clip from it, I couldn’t escape the spoilers regarding the appearance of specific characters, which pretty much ruined any surprise the film could have offered me. Even with that in mind, I still think the ending felt a bit rushed, contradicting the somewhat slow pace during the first two acts.

In the end, there’s no doubt about it. Dragon Ball Super: Broly is, by far, the best Dragon Ball movie to date, and it’s really freaking awesome! It beats any other installment of the franchise, including the latest films. Akira Toriyama working together with a phenomenal team of animators is a match made in heaven. The story is remarkably well-written, with a full half dedicated to introduce and develop Broly as a mentally troubled child who had to deal with so much pain during his life. The animation reaches its peak quality-wise, demonstrating that when time is given to the animators, their work can be a visual masterpiece. With such an intriguing backstory on the history of Saiyans and a brilliantly structured build-up to an epic fight between Broly, Goku, and Vegeta, there was still time to cherish the nostalgia with some nods to previous moments in the beloved saga, as well as some hilarious comedy bits.

With more control over the use of CGI and visual effects, this could very well be one of 2019’s best movies. It still can be, but the climactic final battle lost of a bit of its impact due to the overwhelming VFX which completely overcame the animation itself. The ending is predictable before we reach half-runtime, and the spoiler-heavy trailers didn’t help to keep surprise as a factor. I have to repeat what almost every critic has been saying: if you’re a fan of the saga and you kept up with Super, this will give you everything you want and more. If you’re just a casual moviegoer or if you stopped watching after Z, it’s better if you don’t “poison” social media with opinions on a film that simply wasn’t made for you. 

Thank you, Toriyama! Thank you for giving me the chance to see my favorite anime on the big screen for the first time, and for making it epic. Can’t wait for the announcement of the series continuation …

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,***Well, at least it doesn’t have zombies***

A mass epidemic strikes Earth which makes people go crazy and commit suicide, but only IF they are not blindfolded and SEE the mysterious phenomena. A group of Californians find succor in an abode with covered windows. One woman (Sandra Bullock) and two children try to make it down a remote river to find sanctuary, blindfolded. Trevante Rhodes and John Malkovich costar. 

“Bird Box” (2018) is a post-apocalyptic survival adventure/horror with an original concept and elements of flicks like “The Book of Eli” (2010), “The Mist” (2007), “Carriers” (2009) and “Stake Land” (2010). The reason for the apocalypse is what makes “Bird Box” standout and, thankfully, there are no zombies, yet it’s the least of these for a couple of reasons.

For one, I didn’t find the dramatic dynamics of the group all that captivating, but it was okay. If you’re a fan of Bullock you’ll probably like this movie more than me. I appreciated Rosa Salazar as Lucy, but her role isn’t that significant. Meanwhile Rhodes and Malkovich are effective.

The concept behind the mass crisis is where the movie fails. It’s sort of explained and yet it isn’t. There are too many inconsistencies and what appears to be plot holes. It’s basically a bunch of malarkey and reflects lazy writing. People on message boards debate back-and-forth ad nauseam, but the movie’s too nonsensical and meh to make it worth the effort.

The film runs 2 hours and 4 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Monrovia, La Puente, Santa Clarita, Smith River, Scripps College and Los Angeles).

GRACE: C,Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend, at least as a one-off.

I have technical frustrations with this movie, but it's premise alone is interesting enough that anyone interested in survival style movies should watch it, though I'm not sure how many people are re-watching this.

The movie is cast very well: Sandra Bullock and Jon Malkovich, both wonderfully portray jerk characters in completely different lights, along side several supporting actors who all deliver adequately or better.

As most of the movie takes place inside a single house, they manage to keep things interesting there and vary up a few select locations, to include a city that is amazingly detailed in all the chaos unfurling and a river that is somehow both expanse enough you could feel lost and also claustrophobic in its restriction: it's a movie that presents very well.

My big qualm is the structure of the writing: not the writing itself.  All the dialogue and story arcs are great, but the RIDICULOUS insistence on re-ordering a story and not benefiting from it is just annoying.

The second half of the story is interspersed with the first half of the story so you alternate back and forth.  Really, who tells a story and jumps ahead 3/5 of the way, then back, then when you get to the 3/5 mark, not reiterate what is happening there.

> _How many addicts are out on the street simply because Mr. Sharp brought the cocaine here?_

- Sam Dolnick quoting AUSA Chris Graveline; ""The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule""; _New York Times_ (June 11, 2014)

63 years since he first appeared on-screen (an uncredited role in Jack Arnold's 1955 _Revenge of the Creature_), _The Mule_ is 88-year-old Clint Eastwood's first acting role since Robert Lorenz's _Trouble with the Curve_ in 2012, and his first film as a director since about a week ago. It is, however, the first time he's directed himself since the excellent _Gran Torino_ in 2008. Known for being incredibly efficient when it comes to filmmaking, Eastwood likes to get scripts into production before they've gone through too many rewrites, he rigidly shoots only what's on the page, he avoids multiple takes and on-set experimentation, and he keeps the editing process as simple as possible – so basically, he's the anti-Terrence Malick. With this in mind, he has maintained an extraordinary rate of turnover, with _The Mule_ the 37th feature he's directed since _Play Misty for Me_ in 1971.

Of course, when you work at that rate for as long as he has, you're going to put out a few duds, and although his directorial output has gone through ups and downs in the past, his most recent work has been arguably the most disappointing of his career, with pretty much everything he's directed since _Gran Torino_ being subpar. Whether it's the hokey sentimentality of _Hereafter_ (2010), the oversimplification (and awful makeup) of _J. Edgar_ (2011), the lifeless _Jersey Boys_ (2014), the unashamed and troubling jingoism of _American Sniper_ (2015), the unnecessary embellishments of _Sully_ (2016), or the spectacularly misjudged experiment in casting that was _15:17 to Paris_ (2018), the days when he could direct no less than seven masterpieces – _Unforgiven_ (1992), _A Perfect World_ (1993), _The Bridges of Madison County_ (1995), _Mystic River_ (2003), _Million Dollar Baby_ (2004), _Flags of Our Fathers_ (2006), and _Letters from Iwo Jima_ (2006) – in a 14-year period are long gone. Indeed, the most notable thing he's done in the last decade is ramble somewhat incoherently to an empty chair.

The bad news is that _The Mule_ is a strangely formless film, almost a collection of only vaguely connected scenes rather than an actual narrative with forward momentum; it has precious little depth or nuance; there's some troubling casual racism, most of which we're encouraged to laugh at; the tone is all over the place; Eastwood's character has not one, but _two_ threesomes with young women; and it wastes almost all of its excellent cast. The good news is that, somehow, it's extremely enjoyable, and is easily the best film he's directed since _Gran Torino_.

Telling the story of Earl Stone (Eastwood), a 90-year-old horticulturist and Korean War veteran, the film begins in 2005 as Stone is honoured at a daylily festival. Clearly enjoying the adulation (and the attention from the ladies), he doesn't seem to care that he's supposed to be attending the wedding of his daughter Iris (Eastwood's real daughter, Alison Eastwood). As she frets about his failure to turn up, Mary (Dianne Wiest), Stone's ex-wife and Iris's mother, points out that it's not a shock, as he has a history of letting his family down. The film then jumps to 2017 – Iris hasn't spoken to him since her wedding, and he is estranged from the whole family, except Iris's daughter, Ginny (Taissa Farmiga), who is herself getting married. His daylily business has gone bust, unable to compete with online shopping, and his house is in foreclosure. After a very public dressing down from Mary, Stone is approached by a friend of Ginny's who tells him that he knows some people who will pay anyone with a perfect driving record to ""_just drive_"" for them. Arriving at a garage guarded by heavily armed Hispanics, Stone is told to drive some duffle bags from El Paso to Chicago, with the only rule that he isn't to look inside the bags. He happily agrees, apparently unaware he has just signed on to mule for the Sinaloa Cartel. When he does inevitably look in the bags, finding cocaine, he isn't especially bothered, and as his first few runs go well, the Cartel start to increase the amount of drugs he's muling. So much so that cartel boss, Laton (Andy García), asks to personally meet this new mule, who has been nicknamed ""Tata"" (""Grandfather"") by his handlers. Meanwhile, the leader of a DEA task force (Laurence Fishburne) is under pressure to start getting results, and so he gives agents Bates (Bradley Cooper) and Trevino (Michael Peña) instructions to start making arrests sooner rather than later, which they promise to do, explaining that they are nearing in on a prime target – a prolific mule known only as Tata.

Written by Nick Schenk, who also wrote _Gran Torino_, _The Mule_ is, extraordinarily, based on a true story. Specifically, it's inspired by Sam Dolnick's 2014 _New York Times_ article, ""The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule"", which tells the story of Leo Sharp, an award-winning horticulturist and World War II veteran who became the Sinaloa Cartel's most reliable mule. Despondent from financial problems and the loss of his daylily business, Sharp began transporting cocaine from Arizona to Michigan in 2005. With Sinaloa quickly realising how reliable he was, he was soon moving up to 300 kilograms per trip and transporting as much as $2million dollars in the opposite direction. In October 2011, while in possession of 90 kilograms, Sharp was arrested by Michigan state police operating as part of a DEA task force. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released in 2015 after a year behind bars, due to declining health. He died of natural causes in 2016 at the age of 92.

The first thing to be said about _The Mule_ is that the trailer is misleading. And then some. Suggesting a tense, nail-biting thriller in which Stone is appalled to find out what he has been transporting, but is unable to back out of his deal, and must try to keep the Cartel on-side whilst evading the attention of the DEA, the trailer has next-to-no relationship with the actual film. It's not tense, my nails were thoroughly unbitten, Stone isn't overly concerned when he learns what's in the bags, and the very narrative structure means it's inevitable that Bates will catch up to him sooner or later. It most certainly isn't the Michael Mann-esque crime thriller it's being advertised as. Instead, _The Mule_ is laconic and contemplative, laid-back and not especially dramatic (there's more fireworks in the arguments Stone has with his family than in his relationship with the Cartel, and the film as a whole is more _Last of the Summer Wine_ than _Miami Vice_). Indeed, as drama, _The Mule_ is fairly insubstantial, telling a threadbare story populated by underwritten characters, void of much of an emotional core, and with next-to-nothing in the way of an exciting _dénouement_.

As a director, Eastwood's last three films (_American Sniper_, _Sully_, and _The 15:17 to Paris_) have all told true stories of ordinary people who have come to be seen as heroes for one reason or another, whether they wanted to or not. Earl Stone is definitely not a hero (any more than Leo Sharp), but he is an everyman, a person down on his luck who finds a way to stick it to the system. And that makes him, at best, empathetic, and at worst, an anti-hero (yes, the fact that he's literally transporting misery and suffering is problematic, but we'll get to that). Stone is charming, funny, and intelligent, and his attempts to make up for his mistakes with Iris by being there for Ginny seem genuine. Eastwood plays Stone as full of regret, someone who knows he was a terrible husband and father, and the fact that his estranged daughter is played by his real daughter gives the film the impression of being personal (Eastwood, like Stone, has an, let's be diplomatic, ""appreciation"" for the ladies). From a physical standpoint, Eastwood looks noticeably older than he did in _Trouble with the Curve_; he walks hunched over, he looks frail enough for a strong wind to knock him down, there's next-to-no meat on his arms. Almost all of that Eastwood-ruggedness is gone, and this is easily the most physically vulnerable we've ever seen him on screen, even more so than that other titan of old-school American masculinity, John Wayne, who made _The Shootist_ (1976) when he was literally dying.

In a lot of ways, Stone is not unlike Walt Kowalski, the hateful racist character Eastwood played in _Gran Torino_. They are both Korean War veterans who find themselves alienated from the world they live in, and who believe the next generation lack fortitude (at one point, Stone complains, ""_this generation can't open a fruit-box without calling the internet_""). However, Stone is much softer, and on the universal scale of racism, whereas Kowalski is Mel Gibson-racist, Stone is Prince Philip-racist; the type of racism we forgive because he's 837 years old, half-senile, and grew up ""_in a different time_."" Sure, he calls Hispanics ""beaners"" and jokes about them getting deported, but they don't seem to mind. Sure, he pulls over to help a black couple change a tire, proudly telling them he likes ""_to help the negro folks out_"", but they just politely inform him that people don't use the word ""negro"" anymore. And it isn't just ethnicities. Encountering a group of lesbian bikers, he refers to them as ""_dykes on bikes_"". All three of these examples are played for laughs, and whilst that might be fair enough in a film that depicts non-Caucasians with something resembling diversity, _The Mule_'s non-white characters are one-dimensional stereotypes; every Hispanic character, for example, is either a drug-running criminal (most of whom have neck tattoos) or an industrious labourer. If the film itself didn't come across as so racially reductive, Stone's racism would be easier to accept and defend.

Perhaps the film's most egregious failing, however, is that it never once addresses the fact that Stone's criminal enterprise is fuelling addiction and destroying lives; as far as the film is concerned, he may as well be transporting oranges. The darker implications of his drug-running are kept firmly behind the curtain, out of sight of the audience. Instead, _The Mule_ presents Stone as almost a modern-day Robin Hood, using his new-found cash to pay for Ginny's wedding and education, and to renovate the local VA hall. This _could_ be a sly comment on Obama-era economics, suggesting that the country is in such a mess that issues like the exorbitant price of education and the mistreatment of veterans can only be addressed with the proceeds of crime. But honestly, that's a serious stretch, and it seems far more likely it's the film's way of ensuring we continue to admire Stone despite what he's doing. In any case, even when the film has no option but to directly deal with his criminality, it's done in such a way as to minimise the darker aspects. For example, Laton may be the most jovial and least-threatening drug lord ever put on screen. García does what he can with the part, but given the fact that most of his screen time sees him fooling about with a solid gold shotgun, his options are limited (one legitimately funny moment sees Stone marvelling at Laton's mansion, asking ""_who do I have to kill to get a place like this?_"" to which Laton responds, ""_many, many people_""). A much more effective character is Gustavo (Clifton Collins Jr.), Laton's henchman. Collins Jr. is a superb actor, and can do legitimately intimidating in his sleep, but even an actor of his calibre can do little with only three scenes, in two of which he doesn't even have any dialogue (in a film with a wasted cast, the underuse of Collins Jr. stands out).

Hand-in-hand with the film's non-threatening drug runners is its depiction of local law enforcement, who are, for the most part, presented sarcastically (at one point, Stone distracts a pesky cop with a tub of caramel popcorn). The DEA characters are presented a little more respectfully, however. Fishburne's unnamed character, for example, is depicted as a good agent shackled by a bureaucracy that only cares for short-term wins. Thus, they pressure him to pressure his field agents to get results before the case has matured, meaning any arrests will be strictly low-level. This aspect of the film reminded me of the first season of _The Wire_, where Deputy Ops. Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison) is constantly pressuring Lt. Daniels (Lance Reddick) to get some ""_dope on the table_"" – small scale arrests that provide a photo op for Baltimore PD brass to proudly display the confiscated dope on the table, irrespective of the fact that such operations result in the arrests of street hoppers rather than anyone in management.

A key scene in relation to the film's depiction of both law-enforcement and minorities, but one which is disappointingly played for laughs, is when the cops pull over who they think is Tata only to quickly realise it's the wrong man (it's a young Hispanic) and they're guilty of racial profiling. The man is terrified, well aware of stats concerning police shootings of non-whites (there's something deeply unsettling about how well he knows the routine, and his line, ""_statistically speaking, this is the most dangerous five minutes of my life_"" speaks volumes about modern America). The scene should have given rise to a socio-political commentary – what is it like to be the victim of racial profiling, how does it feel to know that you've just committed racial profiling, what does it say about society in general when an innocent man knows enough about such instances as to fear for his life? Eastwood, however, is more interested in guffaws. We've seen racial profiling and resultant deaths examined in several recent films – Steve McQueen's _Widows_, George Tillman, Jr.'s _The Hate U Give_, and Reinaldo Marcus Green's _Monsters and Men_ (all 2018) – as well as slightly older titles such as Paul Haggis's _Crash_ (2004) and Ryan Coogler's _Fruitvale Station_ (2013), but the depiction here is, sadly, very shallow. The film is also silent on the inverse – that Stone is such a good mule because of his white privilege.

Another issue is that the film's structure is bizarre – there's no real sense of narrative cohesion, as one scene jumps to another without a huge amount connecting them. You could take the various driving scenes, cut them in a completely different manner, and you would still have the same film; Stone picks up the drugs, drives for a while, drops off the drugs and gets paid, drives some more, has a scene with his family, we check in on the DEA, Stone picks up the drugs, drives for a while etc. The whole thing feels void of urgency, and after a while you realise that the threadbare outline of a story is all the story you're going to get. Additionally, there's an utter lack of tension (for which Eastwood tries to compensate with silly scenes such as when Bates follows Stone into a parking lot and shouts ""Hey."" Is he going to arrest our hero? Nah, Stone just left his flask behind). On top of this, the way Eastwood's camera leers at the bare asses of a bunch of women at a party in Laton's house is disconcerting, and pretty much a textbook example of the male gaze. Also, with the single exception of Stone, the characters are one-dimensional at best (Fishburne's character doesn't even get a name; Peña is nothing but the comic relief to Cooper's straight man).

If all that sounds negative, it should, because I focused on what I felt was wrong with the film. However, irrespective of these failings, I thoroughly enjoyed _The Mule_. It could and should have been a lot better. It could have been a socially conscious thriller looking at racial profiling, drug-dealing, American masculinity, generational conflict, socio-economic issues. But, in fairness, that isn't the film Eastwood set out to make. He has made many interesting political films in his career. _The Mule_ is not one of them. Instead, he's turned the material into a jaunty, congenial, inoffensive, and easy-to-watch meditation on age and family, set in a _milieu_ where the one-time trappings of male success are now considered character failings, and focused on a character unable to wrap his brain around this shift in ideology. Despite myself, I can forgive the casual racism, the structural problems, the wasted cast, the use of serious social issues to get cheap laughs, and I can do so because the film is simply enjoyable. _The Mule_ isn't going to change your life, nor is it going to win Eastwood a legion of new fans. But it was never supposed to. Instead, it accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. And it's immensely entertaining to boot.,I wonder if Clint Eastwood is one of the few directors who could have gotten this movie made. It took me a while to get around to watching it, partly due to some of the negative buzz I heard out there in the Interworld.
 
I suspect I liked this movie for the same reason a lot of the bad buzzy folks hated it. How many respected directors have the star power to get a movie made that, even with a violent Mexican drug cartel involved in the plot, turns out to be a thoughtful, mostly gentle character study of an old man awakening fully to regrets of how he treated his family in his younger years. This type of story even goes against the grain of the violent movies that made Eastwood a star in the first place. 

It is not a movie I will likely watch again - there is just too much out there still to see for this movie to draw me in a second time. But it was entertaining, a fine addition to the library of diverse films directed by the Man with No Name.,","mexico,drug crime,drug mule,based on a true story,drug cartel,dea agent,korean war veteran,based on magazine, newspaper or article,2000s,sinaloa,",71,89,"Clint Eastwood,"

- Dick Cheney; _Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America_ (2015)

As a non-American, I've always been fascinated by the concept of a two party system. Breeding rancour and division by its very nature, with only two sides from which to choose on any issue, the more controversial a subject is, the wider the ideological gap becomes. I'm not sure if it's a cause or a symptom, but intricately intertwined with such deep-rooted partisanship is the fact that everyone seems to be preaching to their own choir; Republicans have Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Ben Shapiro (and Alex Jones), whilst Democrats have Bill Maher, Anderson Cooper, and Chris Cuomo (and Cenk Uygar). The problem is that the people watching _Fox and Friends_ and reading _Breitbart_ are already staunchly on the right, whilst those watching CNN and reading _The New York Times_ are already firmly on the left; everyone is sermonising to the already converted, and no one is listening to what the other camp is saying. Written and directed by Adam McKay, _Vice_ is a good example of this; it's a left-leaning film made by left-leaning people for a left-leaning audience. When McKay was asked by the _ACLU_ if he had any theories as to why Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump allegedly walked out of a screening, his response was telling; ""_I think the bigger question is: Why did they buy two tickets and walk in?_""

Ostensibly a biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney, _Vice_ argues that he was actually the _de facto_ President, with George W. Bush taking a back seat, particularly in the globally crucial years from 2001-2003. Very much a political satire in the vein of Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis and Jonathan Swift, or films such as Barry Levinson's _Wag the Dog_ and Joe Dante's _The Second Civil War_ (both 1997), _Vice_ eschews conventional narrative structure, breaks the fourth wall regularly, intercuts shots of fly-fishing and animals hunting into the middle of tense plot-heavy dialogue scenes, features several self-reflexive references to itself, has a false ending, has a scene in which characters speak in iambic pentameter, and in a deleted scene, the entire cast breaks into song. Much as was the case with recent ""based on a true story"" films such as Spike Lee's _BlacKkKlansman_ and Jason Reitman's _The Front Runner_ (both 2018), _Vice_ has one eye on the here and now, using Cheney's story as a vehicle to examine the current political situation in the US, positing that without the power-mad Dick Cheney and the Unitary Executive Theory, there would never have been a Donald Trump. However, although there are many individual moments of brilliance, the film is unsure if it's a straightforward biopic or an excoriating satire, ultimately finding a kind of ideological middle ground that mixes comedy with pathos, not always successfully.

Narrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons), a fictitious veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, who claims to have a unique connection to Cheney, the film begins in Wyoming in 1963 as a young Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) is arrested for drunk driving for the second time. It then cuts to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, as Cheney orders the shooting down of any suspicious commercial airliners, despite President Bush (who was en route to Washington from Florida) not signing off on such an order. How Cheney got from being a drunk in 1963 to taking control of the government in 2001 is the film's primary focus, introducing us to a huge cast of characters (played by an extraordinary ensemble), all of whom feature in Cheney's rise to power in some manner – Lynne Vincent (Amy Adams), Cheney's fiancée and later wife; Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), under whom Cheney worked from 1969, later White House Chief of Staff (1970-1971) and Secretary of Defense (1975-1977 and 2001-2006); Gerald Ford (Bill Camp), President (1974-1977), for whom Cheney was White House Chief of Staff; George H.W. Bush (John Hillner), President (1989-1993), for whom Cheney was Secretary for Defense; Liz (Lily Rabe) and Mary (Allison Pill), Cheney's two daughters; Roger Ailes (Kyle S. More), founder of Fox News; George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell), President (2001-2009), for whom Cheney was Vice President; Scooter Libby (Justin Kirk), Chief of Staff to the Vice President (2001-2005); David Addington (Don McManus), Cheney's legal counsel (2001-2005) and Chief of Staff to the Vice President (2005-2009); Colin Powell (Tyler Perry), Secretary of State (2001-2005); Condoleezza Rice (LiaGay Hamilton), National Security Advisor (2001-2005) and Secretary of State (2005-2009); Paul Wolfowitz (Eddie Marsan), Deputy Secretary of Defense (2001-2005); George Tenet (Stephen Adly Guirgis), Director of Central Intelligence (1996-2004); Karl Rove (Joseph Beck), Senior Advisor to the President (2001-2007); Trent Lott (Paul Perri), Senate Minority Leader (2001-2003); Jay Bybee (Brandon Firla), Assistant Attorney General (2001-2003); and John Yoo (Paul Yoo) Deputy Assistant Attorney General (2001-2003). Within this framework, the film hits all the beats you'd expect – the bombing of Cambodia (1969-1970); the formation of Al-Qaeda (1988); the outbreak of the Somali Civil War (1988); the invasion of Panama (1989); the Gulf War (1990-1991); Cheney's time as CEO of Halliburton (1995-2000); 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan (2001); the ""Torture Memos"" and ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" (2002); the invasion of Iraq (2003); the Plame affair (2003); the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington (2006); the rise of IS; Cheney's 13% approval rating upon leaving office (2009); his heart transplant (2012); and the breakdown in Mary's relationship with her family when Cheney gives Liz permission to oppose gay marriage whilst running for the Senate, despite Mary being a married to a woman (2013).

In writing Vice, McKay focused on five main sources – David Corn's _The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception_ (2003), Ron Suskind's _The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11_ (2006), Michael Isikoff and David Corn's _Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War_ (2006), Barton Gellman's _Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency_ (2008), and Jane Mayer's _The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals_ (2008).

_Vice_ presents Cheney as devoid of ideology, with a Zelig-esque ability to alter his manner so as to best deal with whomever it is in whose company he finds himself. In this sense, his political ambition is portrayed as cynical and mercenary; McKay's Cheney has no interest in attaining power so as to influence policy or stimulate ideological change, he is obsessed only with power-for-power's sake. One of the most telling scenes in the film happens quite early when he learns that President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger are planning to bomb Cambodia without going through Congress. Asking Rumsfeld, ""_what do we believe?_"", he is met by Rumsfeld laughing hysterically at being asked such a ridiculous question. Speaking to The New Yorker, McKay explains,

> _what I found – and I know there are people who disagree with this – was a surprising lack of ideology. I found beliefs that would flip and flop, based on what was convenient and what was strategically useful._

However, although the film presents Cheney as lacking ideology, it does show him as passionate when he adopts (and later usurps) the Unitary Executive Theory (essentially, the idea that the President should have virtually unchecked power to direct the Executive Branch, particularly during times of crisis). McKay tells _The New Yorker_,

> _at one point, he even says the President should have certain monarchical prerogatives._

Speaking to _ACLU_, he says of Cheney's adoption of the Theory,

> _you see it constantly throughout his career – his attempts to expand executive reach, expand executive authority, to operate without transparency, to operate with impunity._

Key lines in this respect include Cheney arguing, ""_if the president does it, it's legal_"", and, when discussing the issue of the US using torture, ""_if the US does it, by definition, it can't be torture_"".

Nowhere is his character shown as more ruthless than in a scene towards the end of the film. In 2013, Liz is running for the Senate when a TV advert from a group affiliated with the incumbent Senator for Wyoming, Mike Enzi, claimed that she ""_aggressively promotes gay marriage_"". Mary had been married to Heather Poe since 2012, and although Cheney and Liz knew it went against their party's doctrines, they had supported her. However, the day after the advert aired, Liz appeared on _Fox News Sunday_ and said she did not support gay marriage. The following day, Cheney and Lynne released a statement supporting Liz, and causing a rift between the family and Mary which remains to this day. The film features a scene the night before Liz goes on TV, in which she asks permission to say she opposes gay marriage. In a chilling moment lifted right out of Francis Ford Coppola's _The Godfather Part II_ (1974), Cheney indicates his approval with a single silent nod of his head. Speaking to _ACLU_ about this scene, McKay states,

> _that to me is what made it a complete and total tragedy and that's the final kind of tally, the final destructive count of power. Is what he did to the country, what he did to countries like Iraq, punching holes in the Geneva Convention, what he did to the checks and balances of our democracy, what he did to the spirit of the American voter, the spirit of the American nation. And then the final thing, the tools that he used_ […] _eventually took down his own family. So to me at that point the tragedy was complete on every level: personal, family, country, world._

Much as in _BlacKkKlansman_, _Vice_ concludes with a haunting montage that brings the story up to date, showing some of the long-term effects of the Bush-Cheney years (instability in the Middle East, irreparable damage to the environment, the rise of IS). In relation to the here and now, although Trump is never explicitly mentioned (and is only shown for a split second in archive footage), McKay is unafraid to admit that the film is not entirely focused on the past. Speaking to the _New York Times_ about Cheney's dismantling of executive checks on power, McKay states,

> _Cheney was the expert safecracker who opened up the safe, and now the orangutan is in there, throwing around the money and the jewels._

He also sees the film as something of a corrective, a reminder of just how bad it was during Bush's time in office, telling _ACLU_

> _somewhere along the line, Donald Trump got elected, and all of a sudden we started hearing people say, ""Hey, I kind of miss George W. Bush. You know, he wasn't that bad, him and Cheney."" And then I really felt like I got to make the movie. I was like, this is crazy that people are saying this._

As with McKay's previous film, _The Big Short_ (2015), _Vice_ is aesthetically audacious. While there are fewer self-reflexive celebratory cameos explaining difficult terminology in direct-to-camera monologues (sadly, there's no Margot Robbie in a bath this time around), the film is edited in such a way as to remind me of Oliver Stone's ""horizontal editing"" in films such as _JFK_ (1991), _Natural Born Killers_ (1994), _Nixon_ (1995), and _U-Turn_ (1997). It's no coincidence that Vice was cut by Hank Corwin, who cut all of the above except _JFK_. This style of hyperkinetic editing can be seen throughout the film. For example, as Chaney attempts to manipulate Bush into agreeing to give him more power, there are intercepts of fly-fishing. It's not subtle, but it is effective. Indeed, this recalls an earlier scene when Cheney is teaching his daughters to fish, explaining,

> _you have to find out what the fish wants, and then you use that to catch the fish._

Elsewhere, much as Stone uses Coke commercials and footage from old films in _Natural Born Killers_, Vice features excerpts from the Budweiser ""Whassup?"" commercial (1999) and _Survivor_. In another scene, when Cheney first learns of the Unitary Executive Theory from Antonin Scalia (Matthew Jacobs), he immediately realises it is his road to power, and the film cuts to a lion bringing down a gazelle. For me though, some of the most effective editing in the film is more conventional. One particularly strong example is as Bush declares war on Iraq, the camera tilts down to show his leg is shaking. The film then cuts to a shot of an Iraqi civilian's leg shaking as the bombs begin to drop.

Also similar to _The Big Short_ is the film's sense of humour, with a tone of irreverence established from the very beginning, as the opening legend states,

> _the following is a true story. Or as true as it can be given that Dick Cheney is known as one of the most secretive leaders in recent history. But we did our fucking best._

A particularly sardonic scene comes about an hour in, as the film shows Cheney stepping away from politics in 1993 and later turning down Bush when he asks him to be his running mate in 2000. At this point, the legend explains that Cheney had chosen his family over politics, and that he happily lived out his days in Wyoming, becoming known as a great philanthropist and fly fisherman. As the Cheneys gather around a family barbeque, triumphant music swells, and the closing credits start to roll, only for the movie to interrupt itself, pointing out that that's not what happened at all, and then continuing with the narrative. It's a very meta technique, and one which both mocks feel-good biopics, whilst also providing a sly criticism of Cheney himself – had he not returned in 2000, the world could have had this happy ending.

Another very funny sequence sees Cheney and Lynne in bed discussing whether or not he should accept Bush's offer, with the narrator explaining,

> _sadly there is no real way to know exactly what was going on with the Cheneys at this history-changing moment. We can't just snap into a Shakespearean soliloquy that dramatises every feeling and emotion. That's just not the way the world works._

This is immediately followed by Cheney and Lynne speaking in _faux_-Shakespearean blank verse (""_Hast blindness usurped vision in you my wife?_"", ""_Mine own blood and will are yours til pierc'd be the last soldier's breastplate, spilling open its jellied ruby treasures_"") as they work themselves up into a sexual frenzy (although technically, this is a duologue, not a soliloquy). There is also a scene in which Cheney meets two oil executives, whose faces are blurred out, and whose names are bleeped every time they are spoken. In another scene, a waiter (Alfred Molina), reads from a menu that features various forms of Cheney-endorsed torture;

> _tonight, we're offering the enemy combatant, whereby a person is not a prisoner of war, or a criminal, which means, of course, that he has absolutely no protection under the law._

After listening to their options, Cheney gleefully declares, ""_we'll take it all_"". There is also a hilarious mid-credit scene, which sees a focus group descend into chaos when a conservative calls a liberal a ""_libtard_"", prompting a mass brawl. Ignoring the fight, however, are two young girls who are instead interested only in speculating as to the quality of the new _Fast & the Furious_ film.

For all that, however, _Vice_ isn't a patch on _The Big Short_, for a number of reasons. For example, whereas in _The Big Short_, the self-reflexive _Tristram Shandy_-style narrative structure worked to the film's advantage, providing a way into the complex story, here it has the exact opposite effect, oftentimes distracting from McKay's thematic concerns, preventing the film from focusing on telling us how (and why) Cheney exploited loopholes in executive power to restructure US foreign policy. McKay is also less successful at moving from scenes of quiet tragedy to scenes of comedy than he was in _The Big Short_.

The most egregious problem, however, is that the film fails to give any kind of psychological verisimilitude or interiority to Cheney. Presenting him in an almost robotic manner, there is very little on what drives him, depicting his various deeds without offering anything cogent in terms of his motivations. Is he simply an ideologically-weak opportunist? Is he an evil megalomaniac fuelled by a deeper purpose, and if so, what purpose, and how? Could it all really have been about power, viewing the global geopolitical sphere as his own personal playground and nothing more? And if the film is arguing this, suggesting that this man, responsible for so much pain and suffering, did it all simply because he liked power, isn't that to downplay his agency, to allow one to argue that he didn't really know how much damage he was causing? Depriving him of psychology weakens any attempt to censure his actions. The film's Cheney is ultimately unknowable, and that makes his acts more easily forgivable. The argument that it was all because of power and greed really does next-to-nothing to help explain the man. And in any case, if we accept the thesis that Cheney cared only for power, then surely he warrants serious moral scrutiny, not a self-reflexive and, at times, self-congratulatory narrative that assumes the audience agrees with it before it has even said anything.

_Vice_ traces all of Cheney's acts back to Lynne dressing him down when he was younger, suggesting that without her prodding, this unambitious two-time Yale dropout would never have gotten into politics in the first place (it's telling, perhaps, that Lynne is unenthusiastic when she learns Cheney is thinking of accepting Bush's offer to be his running mate, pointing out, ""_the VP just sits around and waits for the president to die_""). But to reduce all of it to being told off by wife, seems far too easy, although it could, I suppose, be cited as an example of the banality of evil. Except that the film's Cheney is anything but banal. In fact, he's terrifying.

Cheney pressured the CIA to find links between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein so as to justify invading Iraq. He oversaw the public relations campaign to build popular support for the war. He encouraged the torture of terror suspects all the while denying it was torture. He was responsible for the worst strategic blunder in US history, the growth of a domestic surveillance state, the dictatorialisation of the office of the President, and the deaths of 4,000 American troops and at least 100,000 Iraqi civilians, although possibly as many as 500,000. His contempt for and willingness to rewrite the rule of law makes him a precursor of Trump. Positing him as a man who was power-mad and little else, _Vice_ remains always on the outside, trying to listen through the wall, never managing to open the door and expose his actual inner workings. The comedy and structural experimentation make it entertaining as a film, but it tells us very little about Cheney that we didn't already know. Strip away the artifice, and you'll find it doesn't have a huge amount to say. Never attaining the scale of tragedy to which it clearly aspires, the film functions instead to remind critics of Bush's cabinet why they became critics of Bush's cabinet. In the end, rather than exposing Cheney's dark soul, the film argues that he doesn't have one. And that is a far less interesting thesis.,Vice (2018)

- Adam Kotsko; ""The story of the first Black Friday"" (2014)

One of the most visually and aurally accomplished filmmakers currently working, writer/director Peter Strickland has thus far enjoyed considerable critical acclaim and some limited arthouse and festival success, but has been unable to make much of a mainstream impact. Not that he seems remotely bothered by this, as his latest, _In Fabric_, is easily the most impenetrable and singular work in his increasingly impressive _oeuvre_. On paper, it's all very straightforward – an unsuspecting customer buys a dress that seems to be haunted (or may actually be inherently evil), and it unleashes chaos in her life. But as anyone who has seen any of Strickland's previous films knows, bare plot outlines do little to convey the riches therein – sure, _Katalin Varga_ (2009) is a rape/revenge thriller, _Berberian Sound Studio_ (2012) is a giallo love-letter, and _The Duke of Burgundy_ (2014) is an S&M-themed lesbian romance, but each one goes to some truly unexpected places not in any way suggested by their ostensible subject matter. With _In Fabric_, although it definitely flirts with embracing the transformative power of fine clothing and the positive psychological effects one can experience by wearing something one believes to look fantastic, Strickland is far more interested in roundly mocking some of the more crass elements of consumerism, particularly the pernicious and seemingly irresistible lure of ""the bargain"", and the herd mentality manufactured, maintained, and exploited by retail corporations during Black Friday (an event that if witnessed by aliens would surely lead to them judging us too intellectually rudimentary to bother conquering). _In Fabric_'s biggest single problem is that it's actually made up of two loosely-connected storylines, but because the first one is so much more interesting, it leads to some narrative slackness in the second half, and all in all, it's not a patch on his best work to date, _The Duke of Burgundy_. Nevertheless, it's brilliantly acted, looks (and sounds) amazing, has an unparalleled commitment to the more tactile elements of the medium, is exceptionally funny, and will never allow you look at a washing machine (or a washing machine repairman) in quite the same way again.

Set in a London suburb at an unspecified point in time (although obviously meant to be during the 1980s), the film tells the story of bank teller Sheila Woolchapel (Marianne Jean-Baptiste, playing the role as if she's in a piece of 1960s social realist cinema). A recently-divorced mother to a teenage son, Vince (Jaygann Ayeh), whose older girlfriend Gwen (an unrecognisable Gwendoline Christie having an absolute blast) seems to have moved in without asking, Sheila's life is in a rut (the most excitement she has is watching Vince and Gwen having sex through a keyhole...don't ask). Having recently placed a lonely-hearts ad in the paper, she has an upcoming date, and is determined to make a good first impression, and so visits a Dentley & Soper department store looking to buy something nice in the January sales. Apparently run by a coven of witches who don't even bother trying to conceal their true identities, Sheila is all but accosted by Eastern European sales assistant Miss Luckmoore (Strickland regular Fatma Mohamed, who gleefully plays the role like she's in a Halloween special of _The Simpsons_, and who describes the store as ""_a panoply of temptation_""). Talked into buying a beautiful ""_artery red_"" dress, it doesn't take long for Sheila to realise that something is not entirely kosher about the garment - from prompting dog attacks to trashing her washing machine to floating above her bed to having strange phrases sown into the lining (""_you who wear me will know me_"") to featuring prominently in particularly nasty dreams, clearly the dress is as nefarious as a Dublin-made shell suit (although it looks slightly less ridiculous), and has nothing but bad intentions for poor Sheila. And to make matters worse, the date is a bust. Meanwhile, the wedding of washing machine repairman Reg (Leo Bill) and his fiancée Babs (Hayley Squires) is fast approaching; Sheila's micromanaging bosses, Stash and Clive (a hilarious Julian Barratt and Steve Oram, respectively), have some concerns over her method of shaking hands; Luckmoore and her boss, Lundy (Richard Bremmer), spend their free time doing something questionable to a mannequin; and a game of Ludo between Sheila, Vince, and Gwen redefines the term passive-aggressive.

Apparently inspired by Strickland's childhood memories of being taken to the January sales by his mother, he claims that they made such an indelible impression on his psyche that to this day, he experiences autonomous sensory meridian response whenever he encounters anything related to sales. Irrespective of this, _In Fabric_ is undeniably a consumerist satire, not entirely divorced from something like George A. Romero's _Dawn of the Dead_ (1978). The malignant control that capitalism exerts on the masses, the commodification of desire, the exploitation and manipulation of notions of self-worth, the vulgarity of a materialism serving as its own end - all are interwoven into the film's style, sensuality, and texture, much as the themes of his first three films are indistinguishable from their aesthetic design. Just look at how Strickland uses TV commercials advertising the sales; in a film partly about the impulses that drive us to purchase, these clips are the first (and certainly not the last) indication that consumerism is effectively a form of mass hypnosis. Strickland has a real talent for making theme elevate style into something more meaningful, and _In Fabric_ provides more evidence of that, with the highly-stylised aesthetic commenting on the ultimate emptiness of retail therapy, even as it seems to offer short-term happiness. Leaning into the artificiality of the film's _milieu_, Strickland makes no attempt to construct a believable, lived-in world, asking not only how do the customers of Dentley & Soper not realise something is wrong, but so too querying whether our own real-world behaviour is any different, when we see that item we've been craving turn up in a sale.

With that in mind, although this is not an especially realistic film, it is an absolutely gorgeous film, one that gleefully embraces gaudy 70s kitsch from literally its opening frames (a perfectly manicured hand violently opening a box, followed by the most 70s title sequence you'll see all year). Reproducing the hyper-stylised look of classic giallos, the most obvious touchstone is Dario Argento's _Suspiria_ (1977), with Strickland and his young Australian director of photography Ari Wegner (_The Kettering Incident_; _Lady Macbeth_; _Stray_) bathing the film in a lurid colour palette of over-the-top reds, purples, and greens. The other-worldly vibe is helped immensely by Cavern of Anti-Matter's synth score full of harsh electronic screams and repetitive droning, and the queasy, disorientating sound design by Martin Pavey, executive producer Ben Wheatley's regular sound designer. Filling the soundtrack with non-diegetic whispering and incantations, the aural design keeps the viewer constantly on edge, as if the evil in the dress has somehow infected the magnetic track. Indeed, the sound design is just as important here as it was in _Berberian Sound Studio_, a film which was literally about sound design - just listen to the sounds of the bargain-hunting crowds in Dentley & Soper, with the incoherent mumbling of their stampede into the store turned into a chaotic, animal-like din.

One of the film's most successful elements, and one of the reasons it's so funny, is how ultra-seriously everyone takes the whole thing. Jean-Baptiste, Bill, and Squires (the three ostensible leads) all play their parts as if they're in a Ken Loach film (which all three have been in the past), whilst Strickland, for his part, approaches the whole endeavour with a similar reverence - there's no winking at the audience here, and it's the absence of such winking that makes it all so funny. From Stash and Clive explaining the correct etiquette when meeting the mistress of one's boss to the sexual power that Reg has over women once he starts explaining the inner workings of a washing machine, the film's humour is rooted firmly in the fact that no one involved acts like they're in a comedy, and it's this self-seriousness which is so disarmingly and consistently funny (just look at the Ludo game from hell or the scene where Stash and Clive discuss the difference between ""_looking for staff_"" and ""_trying to find staff_""). The scenes of the dress crawling around Sheila's house are especially funny partly because they look so ridiculous (you can all but see the wires leading off-camera), but mainly because Strickland treats them with complete sincerity, as if he's not actually in on the joke (which he most certainly is). A film about an evil dress shouldn't work on any level except parody, yet it's precisely because the film doesn't seem parodic that it works so well, and that's a testament to his immense control of tone. This is particularly true of the batshit insane proclamations uttered by Luckmoore (""_the hesitation in your voice soon to be an echo in the recesses of the spheres of retail_""; ""_our perspectives on the specters of mortality must not be confused by an askew index of commerce_""; ""_dimensions and proportions transcend the prisms of our measurements_""; ""_did the transaction validate your paradigm of consumerism?_""). This is pure verbal diarrhoea, and can only be in any way effective if it's roundly mocked. And yet, it's the utter dearth of mockery that renders each statement so hilarious.

In terms of problems, by the very nature of what he's trying to accomplish, Strickland is somewhat guilty of allowing the film's sensual elements to overwhelm the characters. Certainly, the film burrows under your skin and lodges there, and Strickland has absolute mastery of the difficult-to-control tactile components of the medium, but aside from Luckmoore, none of the characters really linger in the mind, despite the superb cast. None are especially interesting as people, and when the film focuses on them rather than the inherent strangeness at its core, it slackens quite a bit. From an emotional point of view, there isn't a huge amount of empathy or pathos, and had Strickland focused on just the one storyline, the whole might have worked slightly better. Or perhaps he should have gone in the other direction entirely, making it a kind of ensemble piece, with five or six different storylines, watching the dress affect different people in different ways. Also in relation to this, because the Sheila plot is so much more interesting that the Reg plot, the film seems front-loaded, which is never good. And although it didn't bother me, some people will really dislike the amount of loose ends, unexplained background elements, and narrative dead ends, especially in the bonkers last act.

Nevertheless, I really enjoyed _In Fabric_. Yet more evidence that Strickland is a master stylist (in the best sense of the term), the craft behind the film is simply beyond reproach. Feeling for all the world like a rediscovered giallo, lost for the last four decades and restored to its original glory (complete with _very_ questionable dubbing), it's cryptic and impenetrable, but so too is it hilarious and a feast for the senses. No one makes films quite like Strickland, where the existential and esoteric rub shoulders with the tactile and the sensual, where the textures of the _milieu_ leap off the screen right alongside the themes. Hypnotic, seductive, immensely enjoyable, _In Fabric_ is quite unlike anything you'll see all year.,",,24,27,"Peter Strickland,"

- Karyn Kusama; ""'Maybe at this point I equate femaleness with being radical': Karyn Kusama on _Destroyer_"" (Tasha Robinson); _The Verge_ (January 17, 2019)

In a career spanning nineteen years, the output of director Karyn Kusama has been chequered, to say the least, with her oeuvre ranging from the excellent (_Girlfight_, _The Invitation_) to the average (_Jennifer's Body_, her section of the horror anthology _XX_) to the unwatchable (_Æon Flux_). With _Destroyer_, she once again teams with writers Phil Hay (to whom she is married) and Matt Manfredi, having previously worked with the duo on _Æon Flux_ and _The Invitation_. Partly a film noir along the lines of Robert Siodmak's _The Killers_ (1946) or John Huston's _The Asphalt Jungle_ (1950); partly an anti-hero narrative depicting someone taking the law into their own hands, à la Don Siegel's _Dirty Harry_ (1971), Michael Winner's _Death Wish_ (1974), or Abel Ferrara's _Bad Lieutenant_ (1992); and partly a heist movie borrowing more than liberally from Michael Mann's _Heat_ (1995), _Destroyer_ is an unashamedly pulpy genre piece, confrontationally ugly and unapologetically nihilistic. It's the kind of film one might imagine were we to follow Det. Mills (Brad Pitt) after he opened the box at the end of David Fincher's _Se7en_ (1995), with crippling emotional trauma the protagonist's most salient characteristic. Of course, a damaged cop determined to settle one last score isn't exactly an original concept, and Destroyer never strays too far from the generic tropes seen in films such as Richard Fleischer's _The New Centurions_ (1972), William Friedkin's _To Live and Die in L.A._ (1985), and Oren Moverman's _Rampart_ (2011), or on TV shows such as _Miami Vice_ (1984-1990) and _The Shield_ (2002-2008). However, what it does bring to the table is that the archetypal ""he"" of such narratives is here a ""she"", with Kusama relying heavily on Nicole Kidman's startling warts-and-all performance to do most of the heavy lifting. Although the film does seem to be under the impression that it offers some portentous revelation about the nature of revenge and psychological torment, approaching every scene with an air of self-seriousness that can become grating, there are undeniably individual moments of great brilliance. And then there's that lead performance.

The film begins with burnt-out and psychologically damaged LAPD homicide detective Erin Bell (Kidman) awakening in her car looking decidedly worse for wear. Heading to the nearby scene of a John Doe murder, Bell is not welcomed by the other cops, who can't believe she still has a job. Upon examining the body, Bell notices a distinctive tattoo on the victim's neck. Telling the other cops she may know who the John Doe is, she leaves. Back at the station, she receives an unmarked envelope containing a $100 bill stained from a dye pack. Ascertaining that the bill is from a botched bank robbery committed years previously, Bell comes to believe that the leader of the crew, Silas (Toby Kebbell), who hasn't been heard from in almost 20 years, is back in the city. Determined to find him, dead or alive, she begins to work her way through the surviving members of the crew in an effort to locate him – Toby (James Jordan), who's terminally ill and has been released from prison on compassionate grounds; Arturo (Zach Villa) who has turned his life around and is offering pro bono legal services to immigrants; DiFranco (Bradley Whitford), who wasn't a member of the crew, but did launder money for them and acted as their fence; and Petra (the always-excellent Tatiana Maslany), Silas's girlfriend. Meanwhile, Bell is also trying to deal with her rebellious 16-year-old daughter, Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn), who is dating Jay (Beau Knapp), a man in his 20s. Running concurrently to the film's present, via a series of flashbacks, we learn that 17 years earlier, Bell and her then partner, Chris (Sebastian Stan), were given an undercover assignment to bust Silas and his crew. Posing as a couple, they successfully infiltrated the group, getting the same style of tattoos as seen on the John Doe. However, somewhere along the line, they fell in love for real, with subsequent events resulting in the damaged person Bell has become.

Although Kusama doesn't explicitly foreground it, gender politics are an important aspect of the film. Much has been made of Kidman's physical transformation, although both Kusama and Kidman have argued that her appearance is not what the film is about, nor should it be critics' focus. Still though, we're not quite at a point where a woman altering her appearance for a role is unremarkable (when women do it, it's ""brave""; when men do it, it's ""acting""), and like Charlize Theron in Patty Jenkins's _Monster_ (2003), Kidman's commitment to the part can only be applauded. In terms of the type of character she's playing, much as did Caoilfhionn Dunne in Ciaran Creagh's little-seen Irish film _In View_ (2016), Kidman commits to Bell as an unlikable, violent, and psychologically ruined character, which in and of itself challenges conventional notions of what a female lead should be. It's undeniably fascinating seeing an actress (and a major one at that) get her teeth into the kind of gritty, embittered, and irredeemable character we usually see a man play, especially insofar as the film resists the urge to soften Bell or provide her with a clear road to redemption. In this sense, she has a lot in common with LT (Harvey Keitel) in _Bad Lieutenant_; much of what she does has just as good a chance of dragging her down further to hell as it does of lifting her up. But she's beyond caring about herself, concerned only with busting (and preferably killing) Silas. Of course, she's also a mother, and like so many male archetypes, she has not been there for her child. This aspect of her character in particular, compels the audience to ask questions of itself regarding how men and women are perceived on screen – is a woman neglecting a child more forgivable than a man doing so, or less; do we simply expect women to automatically be good mothers in ways we never consider in relation to men as fathers? What do our presuppositions about motherhood on screen say about us as individuals and as a society?

Kidman's commitment to the role of Bell produces a chameleonic performance that carries most of the film's weight. Never afraid to take risks (see Lars von Trier's _Dogville_, Robert Benton's _The Human Stain_, Jonathan Glazer's _Birth_, John Cameron Mitchell's _Rabbit Hole_, Lee Daniels's _The Paperboy_, Kim Farrant's _Strangerland_), Kidman completely immerses herself within Bell (who is both the destroyer of the title, and the destroyed). With Bell appearing in literally every scene, there's a sense of authenticity in Kidman's performance, almost as if this were a documentary, and Bell was a real person. It's haunting, disturbing, and heartbreaking all at once. Of course, the makeup design by Bill Corso (_How the Grinch Stole Christmas_; _Foxcatcher_; _Kong: Skull Island_), the hair design by Barbara Lorenz (_Last Days in the Desert_; _Nice Guys_; _La La Land_), and, to a lesser extent, Audrey Fisher's costume design all play their part in turning Kidman into this broken shell. The flashback structure is also important vis-à-vis the performance, as Kidman plays Bell very differently in these scenes – her hair is more kempt, her skin smoother (via some subtle de-ageing VFX), her eyes don't droop, her teeth have not yet turned yellow, her gait is more upright, she smiles a couple of times, her voice is more authoritative. This contrast is also true for Toby and Petra. In the flashback scenes, Toby has bleached blond hair, with a loudmouth, devil-may-care attitude, whilst Petra is wide-eyed, something of an innocent, not really taking anything too seriously. When we meet them in the present, however, Toby is literally dying, confined to bed and hooked up to machines to help him breathe, whilst Petra has undergone a similar transformation as Bell – her innocence is gone, replaced by cynicism, anger, and bad skin.

An especially good scene for Kidman (and for Pettyjohn) comes towards the end of the film. Bell and Shelby are in a diner, with Bell trying to scare some sense into her daughter, telling her that she has the potential to do something really good with her life. The dialogue then turns to Shelby explaining that when she was asked to talk about a happy memory with her mother, the only thing she could think of was getting lost in a forest in the middle of winter, with Bell carrying Shelby on her back. Shelby says, ""_I felt safe because I was with you_"". However, she then immediately turns it around, talking about how she realised something was wrong when she noticed Bell's shoes, which were not hiking boots, realising that they were completely lost, and prompting her to ask, ""_why are we even out here?_"" In the flashback, Bell has no answer. In the present, she sheds a couple of tears. But she still has no answer. It's a powerful scene for both actresses, probably the most emotional in the film.

Thematically, the film concerns itself with the long-lasting psychological effects of experiencing significant trauma. No one says Bell is suffering from PTSD, but she sure ticks a lot of the boxes, and rarely has a film been so pessimistic about peoples' ability to recover from emotional damage. DiFranco tells her, ""_you know what successful people do? They get over things_"", and in this sense, she is one of the least successful characters you'll ever see on screen. Her memories are a cancer which has taken over her body and soul, making her loathe herself, with her anguish subsuming every other facet of her being (she never even hints at a smile in the present day).

Aesthetically, Kusama's LA is as cynical as you're ever likely to see the city, and obviously owes a sizable debt to Michael Mann's tendency to depict urban centres so vibrantly as to virtually make them characters - the rain-slicked streets of night-time Chicago in _Thief_ (1981); the bright metropolis of LA in _Collateral_ (2004) and the much darker vision in _Heat_; the neon and humidity of Miami and the clutter and poverty of Port-au-Prince in _Miami Vice_ (2006); the teeming modernity of Hong Kong and the traditions and rituals of Jakarta in _Blackhat_ (2015). The LA seen in _Destroyer_ is a place of dried out waterways, burnt grass, a glaring sun, endless concrete that looks hot to touch, pollution, corruption, betrayal, graffiti, indiscriminate violence. Cinematographer Julie Kirkwood (_The Blackcoat's Daughter_; _I Am the Pretty Little Thing that Lives in the House_) shoots the present in washed-out anaemic hues, white, beige, brown, lots of sun spots and lens flares, whilst she shots the past with a more saturated palette giving the impression of comfortable warmth rather than stifling heat; a neat metaphorical representation of Bell's mindset. Combined with the nails-on-blackboard quality of the score, by composer Theodore Shapiro (_Blades of Glory_; _Tropic Thunder_; _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_), which burrows under your skin, the cumulative aesthetic effect is one of great discomfit.

Of course, there are problems. For the most part, the screenplay is unoriginal and by-the-numbers, and without the power of Kidman's performance, this would have been a straight-to-Blu-ray. Kusama also struggles to break free of the restraints of the genre, which is especially disappointing when you consider the depth of emotion she brought to the otherwise schlocky thriller, The Invitation. The script also seems to be holding something back, teasing the audience with the promise of a big reveal that will transpose Bell's story into something far more universal and esoteric. The first season of _True Detective_ (2014) employed this technique as well, but the difference is that when _True Detective_ pulled the trigger, the reveal was horrifying and worth the wait. In _Destroyer_, it's hard to be certain if there even was a reveal. The script is certainly aiming for profundity, but it's nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is. Along these lines, Kusama makes some very strange directorial choices. Look at the skateboarders near Bell's car in the opening scene, for example, shot chiaroscuro in extreme slow-motion not once, but twice. What exactly is their significance? Why does Kusama shoot them as if they are offering some kind of life-altering revelation? Are they supposed to act as a voiceless chorus? Are they a metaphor for something? The pacing can also be sluggish at times, lacking in urgency, and thus undermining the existential crisis at the heart of the film. This is especially true if you figure out the twist, which my colleague did in literally the second scene.

_Destroyer_ is an average story elevated by the commitment of its leading actress and some laudable aesthetic choices. It's a cynical and humourless film noir aspiring to something more substantial, but never really accomplishing it. However, its unflinching depiction of devastating emotional trauma, presenting Bell as an open wound, slowly bleeding out, is brilliantly handled. The complete inverse of films which depict characters responding to tragedy with humour, optimism, and determination, _Destroyer_ is brutally nihilistic, giving us a character whose obsession is both keeping her alive and killing her. Although it will be far too lugubrious for some, the film has much to recommend it, not the least of which is that extraordinary performance at its centre.,","gang,undercover cop,interrogation,policewoman,teenage daughter,lapd,downward spiral,",30,48,"Karyn Kusama,"

To be a Negro in this country is really - Ralph Ellison has said it very well - never to be_ looked at_. What white people see when they look at you is not visible. What they_ do see_, when they_ do _look at you is what they have invested you with. What they have invested you with is all the agony, and pain, and the danger, and the passion, and the torment - you know, sin, death, and hell - of which everyone in this country is terrified. As a Negro, you represent a level of experience which Americans deny. This may sound mystical, but I think it is proven in great relief in the South. Consider the extraordinary price, the absolutely prohibitive price, the South has paid to keep the Negro in his place; and it has not succeeded in doing that, but has succeeded in having what is almost certainly the most bewildered, demoralised white population in the Western world. On another level, you can see in the life of the country, not only in the South, what a terrible price the country has paid for this effort to keep a distance between themselves and black people. In the same way, for example, it is very difficult - it is hazardous, psychologically, personally hazardous - for a Negro in the country really to hate white people. He is too involved with them, not only socially but historically. No matter who says what, in fact, Negroes and whites in this country are related to each other. Half of the black families in the South are related, you know, to the judges and the lawyers and the white families of the South. They are cousins, and kissing cousins at that. Now, this is a terrible depth of involvement. It is easy for an African to hate the invader and drive him out of Africa, but it is very difficult for an American Negro to do this. He obviously can't do this to white people; there's no place to drive them. This is a country that belongs equally to us both. One has got to live together here or else there won't be any country._

- James Baldwin speaking with Studs Terkel; _The Studs Terkel Program_, 98.7 WFMT Chicago (July 15, 1961)

Based on James Baldwin's 1974 novel of the same name, _If Beale Street Could Talk_ is really two stories in one; there's the love story at the narrative's core, giving the film much of its tonal qualities, and on the surface, there's the socio-political protest about racial injustice and inequality, which provides most of the main plot points. At a quick glance, this should be a masterpiece - there's the foundation of James Baldwin, arguably the most significant African-American author of all time, and this is the first English-language adaptation of one of his novels; there's writer/director Barry Jenkins, fresh off _Moonlight_ winning the 2017 Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay; there's a theme that is (sadly) almost as pertinent now as it was in 1974; there's the vibrant cinematography by James Laxton (_Tusk_), with its lush colours and lyrical compositions; there's a bevvy of hugely talented actors; there's the absorbing and melancholy score by Nicholas Britell (_The Big Short_). This should have been a home run. However, although I found it aesthetically faultless, much like _Moonlight_, I felt the totality was considerably less than the sum of its exceptional parts. Jenkins fails to do justice to either of the narratives running concurrently through the film, with both feeling incomplete, like a pencil-sketch rather than a painting. The biggest problem, however, is the somnolent love story. Employing a Terrence Malick-esque esoteric voiceover, Jenkins lifts entire passages directly from Baldwin. However, what reads beautifully in the novel is badly out of place in the film, even in voiceover, and has the effect of rendering the two central characters completely unrealistic, with their love for one another idealised to such an extent as to become ridiculous. And much like Paweł Pawlikowski's _Zimna Wojna_ (2018), I found _If Beale Street Could Talk_ as formally beautiful as it is emotionally unengaging.

New York, 1974; 19-year old Clementine ""Tish"" Rivers (Kiki Layne) and 22-year old Alonzo ""Fonny"" Hunt (Stephan James), who have known one another since they were children, have fallen in love, and are planning to get married and raise a family. Fonny has quit his job working for a furniture manufacturer, hoping instead to make it as a sculptor. However, when he is accused of rape, the victim mistakenly identifies him in a line-up, and he is charged and detained. Awaiting his trial, Tish visits him in jail, telling him she is pregnant. Ecstatic at the news, Fonny says he can't be in prison when the baby is born, and so Tish and her family determine to do anything it takes to get him out as soon as possible.

With this as the central framework, the story is told in a non-linear style, jumping back and forth from one time period to another, which has an important thematic effect that I'll discuss below. Although Tish and Fonny are very much the centre of the narrative, we also meet a host of characters on the periphery of their relationship. There's Sharon (an absolutely exceptional Regina King), Tish's gentle mother; Ernestine (Teyonah Parris), Tish's acerbic but loving sister; Joseph (an excellent Colman Domingo), Tish's laidback father; Frank (Michael Beach), Fonny's practical father; Mrs. Hunt (Aunjanue Ellis), Fonny's deeply religious mother, who disapproves of the relationship between Fonny and Tish; Adrienne (Ebony Obsidian) and Sheila (Dominique Thorne), Fonny's sisters, who support their mother in everything; Levy (Dave Franco), a kindly Jewish landlord, who rents Fonny and Tish a space in a warehouse being turned into apartments at a reduced rate, because he enjoys seeing couples in love; Officer Bell (Ed Skrein), a racist cop who falsely says he saw Fonny running from the scene of the rape; Victoria Rogers (a superb (and unrecognisable) Emily Rios), the rape victim, who identifies Fonny in a line-up, with a little prompting from Bell, and then flees to Puerto Rico, delaying the trial; Daniel Carty (a heartbreaking Brian Tyree Henry), an old friend of Fonny's who could provide a solid alibi for the night of the rape, but whose testimony is ignored by the courts because he is an ex-con, having recently been released from a two year bit for stealing a car (which he denies doing, pointing out that he can't drive); Hayward (Finn Whittrock), Fonny's lawyer; Pedrocito (Diego Luna), a friend of Fonny's who works as a waiter at an upscale restaurant; and Pietro Alvarez (the always superb but criminally underused Pedro Pascal), with whom Victoria is staying in Puerto Rico.

The title of the novel (and film) is a reference to W.C. Handy's 1917 song, ""Beale Street Blues"", about Beale Avenue in Downtown Memphis (later renamed Beale Street, partially because of the popularity of the song). A mecca of African-American culture, particularly music, in the early 20th century, Beale Street is considered the birth place of Memphis blues, with artists such as Lizzie Douglas (aka Memphis Minnie), Louis Armstrong, McKinley Morganfield (aka Muddy Waters), and B.B. King regularly performing in the many clubs on the street. In 1934, George Washington Lee wrote _Beale Street: Where the Blues Began_, becoming the first African-American writer to be advertised in the Book-of-the-Month Club News. In 1977, Beale Street was officially declared the ""Home of the Blues"" by an act of Congress.

_If Beale Street Could Talk_ prominently features a voiceover narration spoken by Tish. Mainly in the present tense, the _Erzählzeit_ (time of narrating) is an unspecified point in the future, looking back at the events depicted in the film. A lot of the voiceover is lifted either directly from the novel or is a very close paraphrase. For example, in the novel, Tish states,

> _Fonny had found something that he could do, that he wanted to do, and this saved him from the death that was waiting to overtake the children of our age. Though the death took many forms, though people died early in many different ways, the death itself was very simple and the cause was simple, too: as simple as a plague._

In the film, Tish says,

> _you see, he had found something that he wanted to do. And this saved him from the death that awaited the children of our age. And though it took many forms, the death itself was very simple. The cause was simple, too._

Using a voiceover with such eloquent statements, however, creates a significant problem (more on this in a moment).

Aesthetically, much like _Moonlight_, _If Beale Street Could Talk_ looks amazing. From Laxton's vibrant cinematography to the colour coordinated costume design by Caroline Eselin (_Monster's Ball_; _The Paperboy_) - just look at all the yellow in the opening scene, in both the photography and the wardrobe - everything we see rings true, like a Jack Garofalo photograph come to life. Even more visually lyrical than _Moonlight_, the saturated colour palette of _Beale Street_ recalls Douglas Sirk's Technicolour-soaked melodramas, such as _All That Heaven Allows_ (1955) and _Written in the Wind_ (1956). Jenkins has been very open about his admiration for filmmakers such as Sirk, Claire Denis (_Beau Travail_; _Un beau soleil intérieur_) and Hou Hsiao-hsien (_A Time to Live, a Time to Die_; _A City of Sadness_). However, he is most clearly indebted to Wong Kar-wai (_Days of Being Wild_; _In the Mood for Love_; _2046_); seen in Beale Street's non-linear narrative and relatively slight plot, its poetic tone, the centrality of music, and its tendency to use visuals rather than dialogue to convey thematic points (although Jenkins is nowhere near as formally experimental as Wong).

As in both _Medicine for Melancholy_ (2008) and _Moonlight_, Jenkins occasionally has characters speak directly to camera. They're not breaking the fourth wall, however. Such scenes are dialogue scenes, with two characters speaking to one another, so when one speaks directly to camera, it's if the camera is between the two of them. It's a technique that was used most famously (and effectively) in Jonathan Demme's _The Silence of the Lambs_ (1991), where each character looked directly into camera when speaking to Clarisse Starling (Jodie Foster), whereas she always looked just slightly off-camera, setting up a fascinating visual contrast which encourages us to identify with her, as we are presented with her POV, but not that of any of the other characters. _Beale Street_ doesn't do anything as interesting or subtle with the technique, but Jenkins's tendency to use it during moments of heightened emotion does have the effect of suturing the audience into the _milieu_ of the film; we know the characters aren't speaking to us, but it seems like they are.

As mentioned above, the use of a non-linear narrative structure has an important thematic effect. We know from the second scene that Fonny is in jail, meaning that as we watch Tish and Fonny planning their future, renting an apartment, having sex for the first time etc, there's a permanent shadow over everything we see; we know that things go wrong, because we know much more than the characters do. For the most part, this contributes to the tone of the film, thus justifying itself. However, Jenkins overuses the technique, jumping back and forth unnecessarily, without adding anything to the story. An editor once told me that the worst thing someone could say to him about his work is, ""I really noticed your editing"". That's because, unless you're talking about a film where the editing itself is literally part of the narrative, such as Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ (1994) or David Fincher's _Fight Club_ (1999), film editing should be invisible, with the audience never asking questions like, ""_what was the significance of that edit?_"" In _Beale Street_, Joi McMillon and Nat Sanders's editing itself is fine when we're within a scene; it's more the way Jenkins links scenes and chops up the story that draws attention to itself. I understand why the film is told out of sequence, but I don't understand why it's told out of sequence to such an extent. Compare this with Sean Penn's exceptionally underrated _The Pledge_ (2001). For the most part, it's a linear narrative, except that the first scene shows us the protagonist, Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) as a broken-down alcoholic. The rest of the film takes place prior to this scene, so when we see Nicholson fall in love with Lori (Robin Wright) and spend a blissful Christmas with her and her daughter, we know that something terrible is coming, knowledge that casts a shadow over the entire film. Penn accomplishes this with a single scene, right at the start of the film. _Beale Street_, on the other hand, jumps all over the place, never settling into a standardised rhythm, with the cumulative effect becoming one of distraction rather than immersion.

Which brings me to the film's most significant problem - the love story at its centre just didn't work for me. This is partly because of the emotional distance Jenkins maintains, but it's primarily because Fonny and Tish don't seem like real people, not in the way they gaze into one another's eyes as if they are seeing each other for the first time, not in the way they speak to one another as if every syllable is of earth-shattering portentousness; not in the way that everything they say is spoken with a cloying (and ultimately irritating) sanctity. They rarely sound like real people; instead, they adopt the eloquence of James Baldwin. In lifting sections directly from the novel, Jenkins has failed to consider the differing demands of the medium - what works on the page, doesn't necessarily work on the screen, and the reproduction of Baldwin's rich and lugubrious prose is simply unrealistic, with the delivery sounding stilted and awkward, and, most egregiously, far beyond the lexicon of the characters. This is especially apparent in Tish, whose expressive voiceover is far beyond anything we see of her character in the film itself.

In this sense, they don't come across as people with their own interiority and psychological verisimilitude, instead functioning as cogs in the machinations of Jenkins's thematic concerns. Tish, in particular, feels like a cypher, because of her dual role as a young girl trying to get her man out of jail, and a sage-like observer of institutionalised racism in the US. Fonny too has an important dual role - that of a young man falsely imprisoned, and that of a tragic figure standing in for the millions of African-Americans unjustly imprisoned throughout history. Jenkins doubles down on this point by intercutting the film with black-and-white photographs of chain-gangs and police brutality; amongst others, we see Henry Smith, Jesse Washington, Will Brown, Emmett Till, and the Freedom Summer Murders. The point is clear; Fonny is a grand representative of the crimes committed against Africa-Americans in the US. However, his character never attains the kind of grandeur such a representative must, by definition, possess.

There are also some smaller problems worth noting. For example, in voiceover, Tish says,

> _New York must be the ugliest and the dirtiest city in the world. If any place is worse, it's got to be so close to hell that you can smell the people frying._

Evocative words taken directly from the novel, but the New York of the film is anything but ugly; it's picture-postcard perfect, with the streets curiously deserted. Oftentimes Tish's narration simply describes something we can see for ourselves, whereas elsewhere, Jenkins doesn't seem to trust the audience to understand his meaning, so he'll emphasise it to be sure. A good example is Levy, the Jewish landlord. Lest the audience not understand the significance of his Jewishness, there's a shot from beyond with his skullcap prominent in the frame. It's just overkill.

Another problem concerns the depiction of Bell, the racist cop who frames Fonny. Played as a leering pantomime villain, with bad hair, bad teeth, and bad skin, he's obviously a metaphor for the ugliness of racism, but he's so completely over the top, it rips you right out of the film. He'd be more at home in a video game than a socially conscious exploration of the challenges facing African-Americans in the US. On the other hand, Regina King's portrayal of Sharon is exceptional, and completely worth her Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress. King has been giving superb under-the-radar performances for a while now, particularly on TV, in shows such as _Southland_ (2009-2013), _American Crime_ (2015-2017), and _Seven Seconds_ (2018). However, if you really want to see what an acting powerhouse she is, she's never been better than she was in the second season of Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta's criminally underrated _The Leftovers_ (2014-2017), and she brings much of the silent depth with which she portrayed Erika Murphy in that show to _Beale Street_. The scene where she heads to Puerto Rico to try to persuade Victoria that Fonny didn't rape her is one of the most harrowing things you'll see on screen all year, with King conveying her emotional state primarily by her facial gestures (Rios is also superb in this scene, which is probably the best in the film).

_Beale Street_ is an undeniably beautiful film that depicts the love between two astonishingly attractive people; it's worth noting that in the novel, Fonny is described as having

> _skin just like raw potato, wet potato rinds and eyes like a Chinaman and all that nappy hair and them thick lips. And so bow-legged he had bunions on his ankle bones; and the way his behind stuck out, his mother must have been a gorilla._

This most certainly does not describe Stephan James. Lacking the raw emotion of Baldwin's novel, Jenkins's interpretation turns Fonny and Tish into a Ken and Barbie-esque couple, undermining Baldwin's depiction of them as very much existing in the realistic _milieu_ seen throughout the novel. Taking a meditative approach to the material, Jenkins's adaptation never rings true. Whereas Baldwin's Tish and Fonny are flawed, contradictory, and, most importantly, relatable, Jenkins's protagonists are too-perfect-to-be-real, with every agonisingly serious pronouncement they make to one another pushing them further and further from connecting with the audience on an emotional level.,","new york city,based on novel or book,1970s,romance,flashback,lawyer,harlem,devoted family man,false imprisonment,love story,",21,34,"Barry Jenkins,"

Perhaps what I like the most about this movie is the treatment of the stars' wives. As the agent character states, the two wives are also a sort of double act.

When one thinks of contemporary French cinema, few names seem as ill-fitting for a docudrama about an ongoing real-life case involving the abuse of children by a Catholic priest than François Ozon, the prolific and formally inventive filmmaker best known for erotically-charged films such as _Sitcom_ (1998), _Les amants criminels_ (1999), _Swimming Pool_ (2003), _5x2_ (2004), and _Jeune & Jolie_ (2013). Originally planned as a documentary, _Grâce à Dieu_ [_By the Grace of God_] is a partly-fictionalised account of the case of Fr. Bernard Preynat and the formation of La Parole Libérée [known in English as Lift the Burden of Silence], an advocacy group for victims of childhood sexual abuse. Probably Ozon's most formally conventional work, with none of his usual visual panache, the film was modelled after Tom McCarthy's exceptional _Spotlight_ (2015), which examined the Boston Globe's 2002 investigation into sexual abuse in the Boston Archdiocese going back decades. This comparison is important insofar as it speaks to Ozon's lack of formal gymnastics; in short, as with Spotlight, the conventional style is matched to the thematic seriousness, wherein neither director wants to run the risk of elements of the form distracting from the content (not that any visual or aural trickery would help either to tell their particular story). _Grâce à Dieu_, however, is not a Catholic-hit job; rather it depicts the institutional dissembling and prevarication as coming not necessarily from a place of evil, but from a desire to avoid another scandal. Nonetheless, the Church as depicted very much talks a lot about forgiveness and redemption, but seems to have very little understanding of justice or punishment. It's weighty stuff, and although it courts a narrative objectivity and stylistic restraint that often suggests a void of emotion, for the most part, this is undeniably powerful cinema.

The film begins in 2014 as Alexandre Guérin (Melvil Poupaud), a respected banker and devout Catholic, discovers that Fr. Bernard Preynat (Bernard Verley), the priest who he believed to have been defrocked for sexually abusing him, is not only still a priest, but is still working with children. He contacts the Archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin (François Marthouret), and is urged to meet with Preynat. He does so, hoping for Preynat's resignation, but although Preynat openly admits to molesting young boys, he refuses to apologise or admit to wrong-doing publicly. When the church says it can't take the matter any further, citing the 20-year statute of limitations, Alexandre, who has raised his five children in the faith, feels compelled to act, and so, very reluctantly, he takes his story to the press. He is soon contacted by François Debord (Denis Ménochet), who also claims to have been abused by Preynat. Now an atheist, the more militant François advises marshalling the power of social media, and has formed an advocacy group which he hopes will be able to stand against the church and see Preynat not just defrocked, but criminally convicted. Soon, Alexandre and François are joined by a third man, Emmanuel Thomassin (a heart-breaking turn by Swann Arlaud), whose entire adult life has been negatively affected by his childhood.

Ozon originally planned _Grâce à Dieu_ as a documentary, and the screenplay is based on much of his own research, including interviewing the founders of La Parole Libérée. Although the film's central trio are fictional composites, the sequence of events is closely based on real-life, whilst both Preynat and Barbarin are very real. Using his position in Saint Luc Scout Group in the parish of Sainte Foy-lès-Lyon, Preynat is believed to have molested up to 85 boys over a thirty 30-year period, most between the ages of 9 and 12, and in July, primarily as a result of the events depicted in the film, an ecclesiastical tribunal imposed the maximum sentence by defrocking him. A criminal trial is scheduled for 2020, delayed partly because of the film itself, which Preynat's legal team tried to block from release, arguing it would prejudice a jury against their client. However, the fact that we're discussing the film at all should tell you how that ended. In March of this year, Barbarin was convicted of failing to report abuse, receiving a six-month suspended sentence. He offered his resignation as Archbishop of Lyon to Pope Francis, but Francis, ""_invoking the presumption of innocence_"", rejected the resignation, telling Barbarin to take whatever action he thought best. Barbarin subsequently announced that Fr. Yves Baumgarten, Lyon's vicaire général modérateur, would temporarily replace him until a more permanent successor could be found. In June, Bishop Michel Dubost was appointed Administrateur apostolique [Apostolic Administrator] _sede plena_, meaning that although Dubost is in charge of the Archdiocese, Barbarin, who's appealing his sentence, retains the title of Archbishop of Lyon.

_Grâce à Dieu_ is a broadly dispassionate film, and one of the results of Ozon's shunning of directorial flourishes is that there's never anything even remotely sensationalistic. However, although his flamboyant inventiveness is largely absent, the narrative structure is aesthetically interesting. Rather than telling the stories of Alexandre, François, and Emmanuel concurrently, Ozon structures the film in the style of a relay, giving the narrative over to each of them in turn. So at the end of act one, Alexandre meets François, who then takes the narrative reigns, with Alexandre largely absent from act two. François, in turn, then gives way to Emmanuel. Of course, there is overlap, and towards the end, Alexandre re-emerges as the protagonist, but what this style allows for is a slightly different story-telling technique for each man. Alexandre's act is largely epistolary, with the letters between himself and Barbarin read in voiceover. The formality of such a style nicely captures his formal relationship with the Church – he has no desire for a public scandal and believes in going through the proper channels. Once the far more bullish and theatrical François takes over, the style becomes more confrontational (at one point, Alexandre has to talk him out of hiring a plane to sky-draw a penis above the Cathédrale Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Lyon, one of the film's few moments of levity). Then, in the third section, which focuses on the emotionally fragile Emmanuel, the film is at its most empathetic, with the formality of the first section and the rugged directness of the second replaced with a stronger sense of humanism and emotionality. In a film noticeable for its director's formal restraint, it's a well-handled and subtle way of matching form to content without necessarily foregrounding it. This structure also lends itself to exploring the psychological specificity of each man, making for a more ruminative narrative than would have been possible via concurrent editing.

This is important because Ozon is also interested in the mechanics of healing, with all three men dealing with their experiences in different ways, which, in and of itself, reminds us that whilst we tend to think of outrages such as this with a kind of collective mentality, the actual scars of abuse are as unique as each victim is from one another. Although Alexandre found strength in his faith, he has been forced to compartmentalise (""_this is about morality, not faith_""), which has put him constantly on the defensive about how his actions are not intended as a form of attack against the Church, arguing ""_it's about justice, not revenge_"" and ""_I'm doing this for the church, not against it_"", as he points out that ""_families need to know the Church will always protect children_"". However, whereas Alexandre reaffirms his faith, François rejects his, arguing, ""_my faith is human, not Catholic hypocrisy_"", and whilst Alexandre urges forgiveness, François argues, ""_if you forgive him, you'll be his prisoner forever_"". For Emmanuel, the process of healing seems barely to have begun, if it ever will. However, the film is especially unequivocal in asserting that for all three men, and by extension all victims of childhood sexual abuse, the trauma will never leave them, it's a part of who they are, not necessarily the main part, but a part nonetheless, a part with which they will always wrestle, with references to how ""_the burden of silence is heavy to lift_"" and how difficult it is to ""_live in the shadow of what he did_"".

Thematically, Ozon makes no bones about his disgust that Preynat sees himself as a victim, tearfully telling Alexandre, ""_I've always been attracted to children – it's caused me such pain._"" Indeed, he even intimates that the real villain is the Church itself for not stopping him. This is certainly one way of looking at things; the Church is unquestionably at fault for covering up and ignoring the actions of men like him, but that doesn't somehow absolve those men of blame. The institution is culpable, of course, but the responsibility for the act is non-transferable. The hesitancy of the Church to act in cases such as this is represented by Barbarin, whose failure to properly respond is sharply mocked when Ozon details his ridiculous focus on trivial aspects of the case – he's especially worried about the term ""paedophile"", arguing that because, etymologically, the word refers not to abuse but simply to loving children (it comes from the Greek ""paîs"" or ""paidós"", meaning ""child"", and ""philía"", meaning ""friendly love""), it should be replaced by ""paedosexual"". Because that's what's important.

From a more critical standpoint, Ozon overuses the epistolary format in the first act. I understand why he went with this approach, as (apart from establishing Alexandre's more formal relationship with the Church) it has to lay down a lot of background. But, for me, he goes overboard – at times the first act feels less like a coherent narrative held together by the epistolary form and more like a series of letters occasionally interrupted by ""on-screen"" events. This creates an occasional sense of dramatic inertia that wouldn't be a problem in a non-visual medium, but which can drag a film down. The film also occasionally finds it difficult to escape its origins as a documentary, with some scenes, notwithstanding the universally superb acting, feeling more like respectful yet clinical reconstructions rather than scenes in a narrative drama hoping for a degree of emotional connection. The fact that the case is still ongoing also robs the film of a natural structure, as if the story ends before we get to what we would expect to constitute the final act, and one wonders if perhaps Ozon wouldn't have been better waiting until the conclusion of the criminal trial.

But given the overall strength of the non-intrusive direction, the brilliance of the acting, and the clearheaded portrayal of such an emotive topic, criticising Ozon for such things seems almost churlish. Less procedural than the investigative journalism-basis of _Spotlight_, _Grâce à Dieu_ is no less honest or unsettling a film. It may be too controlled for some, whilst the measured pacing and hefty subject matter will undoubtedly put off others. Nevertheless, uncharacteristically solemn for Ozon, it is another important document on a subject that, sadly, seems unlikely to go away any time soon.,","child abuse,lyon france,",64,17,"François Ozon,"

> _In most movies like this, these sort of psycho, sexual thrillers, the female character is there to be a damsel in distress, there to be naked or there to be killed in a really brutal way. This movie sets up, here's a guy who wants to kill a prostitute, so you think the movie is getting to deliver all those things, but it so doesn't. The beauty of Mia's character is that she doesn't let herself be any of those tropes, she doesn't let herself be a damsel in distress, get killed, be taken advantage of; she really is the one with all the power and_ _the one that's playing on the mind games._

- Nicholas Pesce; ""Nicolas Pesce on His Film Adaptation of Murakami Ryu's _Piercing_"" (Eric Ortez Garcia); _Screen Anarchy_ (October 2, 2018)

From Nicholas Pesce, the writer and director of _The Eyes of My Mother_ (2016), and based on the 1994 novel by Ryû Murakami (who also wrote the novel upon which Takashi Miike's similarly themed _Ôdishon_ (1999) was based), _Piercing_ is a darkly comic psychosexual thriller. Partly a screwball comedy about a fastidious man's attempt to murder a prostitute, and his confusion and helplessness when he realises that that prostitute is far more disturbed than he is, the film dares the audience to attempt to figure out who is in charge at any given moment, and to ponder whether one (or both) of these characters would actually be quite happy to be the other's victim. Purposely made to look like a sleazy seventies skin flick (the kind you might expect to see being shot on _The Deuce_), the film's sense of nostalgia drips off the screen, manifest in everything from the music borrowed from giallo films to the art-deco production design to the patently fake urban skyline to the lurid opening credits (complete with retro ""Feature Presentation"" card). In this sense, Pesce is a stylist, in the best sense of the term. However, at the moment, he is a stylist without much to say; as in _The Eyes of My Mother_, he is unable to match his not-inconsiderable aesthetic acumen with any kind of significant or tangible emotionality. The two leads are not necessarily the type of characters we're naturally predisposed to feel empathetic towards, but we surely must be expected to feel **something**. Anything. However, with no real sense of psychological verisimilitude nor much in the way of interiority, they remain essentially blank canvases, and primarily for this reason, the film feels more like a sketch than a finished product.

Set in a non-specific city, the barely-there plot concerns Reed (Christopher Abbott), the clean-cut kind of psychopath about whom the neighbours would undoubtedly say, ""he was always such a nice quiet young man."" Reed has been having some less-than-wholesome thoughts about his new-born baby, and as the film begins, he's standing over the baby's cot, ice-pick in hand, trying to resist the urge to kill the infant. Only when his partner, Mona (Laia Costa), awakens and calls out to him, does Reed regain his faculties. He then explains, in voice-over, his plan to entrap a prostitute in a hotel room, and murder and dismember her, thus purging himself of the desire to kill his own child. Telling Mona he is going on a business trip, Reed checks into a hotel and books a prostitute who is open to S&M (this way he'll be able to tie her up without her becoming suspicious). Planning every aspect of the murder, he rehearses everything from how long the chloroform will leave her unconscious to how best to carry her to the bathroom to begin the dismemberment, and records every detail in a small book. However, when the prostitute arrives, things go down-hill fast, as Jackie (a superb turn from Mia Wasikowska) is far from completely sane herself. Immediately beginning to masturbate, she throws Reed off his game-plan, causing him to laugh nervously. Seemingly annoyed, she retreats to the bathroom, and refuses to come out. After knocking repeatedly on the door to no avail, Reed, who is still hopeful of being able to salvage the evening's homicide, opens the door and walks in on her. Then things get very weird.

Partly a film about coming to terms with desires deemed fetishistic by society, and partly an erotic thriller about two people who seem genuinely confused as to whether they're teammates or opponents, the film's most salient theme is, perhaps, the issue of sexual consent, and how easily muddled it can become. It's a brave theme to take on in this post #MeToo era, with the film daring to ask whether consent should still be applicable if a person has consented to something harmful to their person, even up to the point of consensual homicide. Although there's no cannibalism in the film, the storyline reminded me a little of the 2001 case of Armin Meiwes. Looking for a volunteer to eat, Meiwes posted an online ad, ""_for a well-built 18- to 30-year-old to be slaughtered and then consumed_."" The ad was answered by Bernd Jürgen Brandes, who went to Meiwes's home, where the two made a four-hour video which depicted Meiwes killing Brandes with Brandes's complete consent, and eating parts of him. Initially sentenced to eight years in prison for manslaughter, Meiwes was re-tried in 2005, after a German court argued he had killed for sexual gratification. Meiwes claimed he had only killed Brandes because Brandes asked him to do so, and sexuality had nothing to do with it, but in 2006, he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The film doesn't deal with the case explicitly, but the shifting sexual power-play between Reed and Jackie, and the fact that at least twice, one of them believes they've been granted permission to murder the other, raises similar moral issues.

Within the parameters of this theme, one of the most obvious aspects of the film is its sense of humour, with many of the laughs coming from how utterly anal Reed is. Half Patrick Bateman, half Frank Spencer, once an unpredictable human element is introduced into his scheme, he finds himself unable to think on-the-fly. As his meticulously laid plans go up in smoke, he proves comically inept at handling any kind of interpersonal relationship (one wonders how he ever wooed Mona). However, the fact that most of the comedy lands on his shoulders throws into relief perhaps the film's most egregious problem; although a good 90% of the narrative is told from his perspective, there's precious little to his personality. Granted, a couple of final-act flashbacks fill us in on why he is so obsessed with murder, but his character simply isn't capable of filling out the film's 81 minutes. And there's less character detail on Jackie than there is on Reed. And there's even less character detail on Mona than there is on Jackie. Despite this, Wasikowska gives a superb performance, all facial tics, unspoken volatility, and nervous mannerisms, with an almost balletic way of moving. The actress is able to find far more psychological nuance in the character than is ever hinted at in the script.

I'm not familiar with Murakami's novel, but I gather that much of the character background that is noticeable by its absence from the film is very much present in the book. According to a colleague of mine, the novel's main focus is the psychology of the two leads (in the novel, Reed's character is Kawashima Masayuki, and Jackie's is Sanada Chiaki), exploring the ways in which childhood trauma lingers into adulthood, manifesting itself in unexpected and exceptionally destructive ways. This aspect has been all but stripped away from the film (apart from the brief aforementioned flashbacks). I'm also told the dark comedy aspect is relatively unique to the film, with the novel working more like a tragedy. In this sense, Pesce seems to have made a conscious choice to trim the book's character beats back to their barest elements, replacing the psychological verisimilitude with a self-depreciative sense of humour and ultimately pointless kinky power-play. Indeed, speaking to Indiewire, Pesce states,

>_the script probably started out darker than the movie became, but I think through the process of making the movie, we saw what kind of wackiness there was potential for. Particularly in a lot of Japanese literature, there is this awesome sense of humour about the darkest stuff. And while it works differently in a book than it does in a movie, I think through the course of making it, we found how playful it was._

The problem for me is that nothing in the film really lingers – and when some of the imagery is this extreme, it should definitely linger. For example, I've never been able to completely forget my first viewing of _Ôdishon_ – not because of the violence per se, but because the film spends so long building up the character of Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), so that when those needles and that wire saw come out, you absolutely feel the weight of what is about to happen. In _Piercing_, I don't really think there's any depravity that Reed and Jackie could have inflicted on one another than would have provoked an emotional response, because I didn't know them, and therefore was unable to care about them, as people.

Aesthetically, however, there's a great deal to praise here, with the sound design particularly inventive. During Reed's rehearsal of the murder, he goes through the entire act, from the initial drugging to the dismemberment. On screen, we see him pantomime the actions, but on the soundtrack, we hear the disturbing foley of everything – so as he's miming sawing, we hear a saw cut through flesh and bone. It's a brilliant way to place us firmly within his subjective experience, and it also serves to remind us that the innocent looking Reed is very much planning to do real harm to someone. On a similar note, the music is absolutely top notch. Eschewing an original score, the film instead employs pre-existing tracks primarily from giallo films, including Goblin's scores for Dario Argento's _Profondo rosso_ (1975) and _Tenebre_ (1982), and Bruno Nicolai's score for Emilio Miraglia's _La dama rossa uccide sette volte_ (1972).

The visual aesthetic is oftentimes as impressive as the aural. Exteriors (of which there are very few beyond the opening and closing credits) are obviously miniatures, with very little effort to make them look photorealistic. This sets an otherworldly tone right from the start, as if the film is taking place in a slightly alternate reality, as the real and the fake mix together in Reed's confused mind. Interiors are blank, as if they are show-houses, not actually inhabited by a flesh and blood person – one shot, for example, shows a drink's cabinet where the bottles have no brands, just the name of the alcohol. Again, this sets the film's reality apart, as if everything is happening just outside our own world, or our own conception of the world. There are also a couple of nods to the master of body horror, David Cronenberg – a stomach wound pulses and expands as if breathing, a gigantic beetle crawls out of a toilet and infects a character's face, scissor wounds are curiously fingered, a character's ear is split open with a tin opener. It's all very Disney!

Ultimately, however, _Piercing_ is more interested in aesthetics than exploring the psychology of the characters. The increasingly extreme goings-on are never anything more than a jokey end unto themselves, with the psychological path that has led the characters to these extremities relatively ignored. With Pesce focused on comedy beats, there are certainly a few laughs, but there's precious little substance. He's undoubtedly adept at evoking the most absurdly grotesque comedy, but he is, thus far in his career, equally as uninterested in developing character or plot. And for that reason, the film comes across more like a calling-card than a self-sustained and complete product.,","prostitute,based on novel or book,planned murder,murder of prostitute,escort service,psychological thriller,married man,",8,20,"Nicolas Pesce,"

- Robert Greene; _Greenes Groats-VVorth of witte, bought with a million of Repentance_ (1592)

""We know very little about the life of William Shakespeare."" If you're ever reading something that says this, or any variation thereof, stop reading, and find something by someone who knows what they're talking about. Because the simple fact is that we know a great deal about the life of William Shakespeare. In fact, we know more about the life of William Shakespeare than we do about all of his contemporary dramatists and poets. Combined. There are, however, three areas where our information is sketchy. The first is that we don't really know anything about his personal opinion of the plays - did he have a favourite; were any of them personal for him; did he prefer comedy or tragedy, etc. The second is the so-called ""Lost Years""; 1578-1582 (from leaving grammar school at 14 to marrying Anne Hathaway at 18) and 1585-1592 (from the baptism of his twins, Hamnet and Judith in Stratford-upon-Avon, to a contemptuous reference to him by Robert Greene in his tract _Greenes Groats-VVorth of witte, bought with a million of Repentance_ as an up and coming dramatist who has already achieved considerable success in London). The third area for which we don't have a huge amount of information is the time from the burning down of the Globe Theatre on June 29, 1613 to Shakespeare's death on April 23, 1616.

And it is this later period explored by Kenneth Branagh (as director, producer, and star) in _All Is True_. A pleasant enough film obviously born from great reverence, and, unsurprisingly, brilliantly acted, it's a curiously formless piece of work, clumsily episodic in structure, and relatively free of conflict, focusing instead on non-incident and trees silhouetted against picturesque sunsets. By the very nature of the years during which it takes place, Ben Elton's screenplay is full of interpolations and suppositions, some of which are interesting, but many of which don't work. There's a much better film hidden in the contours of _All Is True_, a darker story examining Shakespeare's psychology; his inability to process the death of Hamnet, his guilt over the fact that he put his career ahead of his family, his possible misogyny, his obsession with his legacy. These issues are in the background, but they are not the focus, and whilst _All Is True_ is perfectly fine, it's also perfectly forgettable.

The film begins on June 29, 1613, as Shakespeare (Branagh) watches the Globe Theatre burn to the ground, after a canon misfired during a performance of _All Is True_ (later renamed _The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight_). Devastated by the loss of his theatre, Shakespeare decides to retire and return home to Stratford for the first time in 20 years (curiously, it is never mentioned that _All Is True_ was most likely a collaboration with John Fletcher, or that _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, also written with Fletcher, was Shakespeare's last play). Coldly received by his wife Anne (a miscast Judi Dench; more on that in a moment) and youngest daughter, Judith (a superb Kathryn Wilder), he gets a slightly better welcome from his eldest, Susanna (Lydia Wilson). Still mourning the death of Hamnet (Sam Ellis), his only son, who died from plague aged 11 in 1596, Shakespeare decides to grow a garden to honour his memory. However, he must also try to deal with Judith's hatred for him, stemming from her conviction that he believes the wrong twin died, an accusation he seems reluctant to deny.

And that's about it as far as the plot goes, with everything else treated like a subplot – the animosity between Shakespeare and Susanna's devoutly Puritan husband John Hall (Hadley Fraser), a physician who believes every theatre in the country should be closed; Shakespeare's frustrations at having to deal with contemptuous local magistrate Thomas Lucy (Alex Macqueen at his smarmy best); Judith's reluctance to marry Tom Quiney (Jack Colgrave Hirst), a hard-drinking vintner with a reputation as a lady's man; accusations that Susanna is having an affair with the local haberdasher, Rafe Smith (John Dagleish); and Shakespeare's embarrassment that the sonnets he wrote for Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton (Ian McKellen) were published illegally, much to Anne's shame.

In terms of significant artistic output, Kenneth Branagh has few peers. The only person in history to have been nominated in five different Oscar categories, he has written and/or directed films such as the noir-homage mystery thriller _Dead Again_ (1991), the irreverent ""luvvie"" comedy _Peter's Friends_ (1992), the flawed but vastly ambitious _Mary Shelley's Frankenstein_ (1994), the scaled-back romantic comedy _In the Bleak Midwinter_ (1995), the visually stunning but narratively weak musical _The Magic Flute_ (2006), and the unpopular but aesthetically fascinating remake of _Sleuth_ (2007). More recently, he has become an in-demand director-for-hire, working on such big-budget franchise films as (none of which I've seen) _Thor_ (2011), _Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit_ (2014), _Cinderella_ (2015), and _Murder on the Orient Express_ (2017), with _Artemis Fowl_ and _Death on the Nile_ both forthcoming. It could very well be the case that _All Is True_ is a palette-cleanser, allowing him to return to the familiarity of Shakespeare, and work on a more intimate film after several years on relatively impersonal projects.

Of course, this is not his first filmic engagement with Shakespeare, and it is in his Shakespearean adaptations where, I believe, his real and lasting contribution to cinema can be seen - his extraordinary directorial debut, the savagely anti-war _Henry V_ (1989), worth seeing just for his recitation of the ""St. Crispin's Day"" speech from IV.iii; the energetic and fun-loving _Much Ado About Nothing_ (1993); the divisive 242-minute _William Shakespeare's Hamlet_ (1996), audaciously filmed on 70mm; the box-office bomb that was his bizarre (but entertaining) musical adaptation of _Love's Labour's Lost_ (2000); and the self-reflexive Japan-set _As You Like It_ (2006). And this isn't even to mention his acting-only roles in film and on TV, his vast list of theatrical credits (which has seen him play Hamlet in no less than five different productions), his radio and audiobook work, and his appearance at _Isles of Wonder_, the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, where he played Isambard Kingdom Brunel reciting Caliban's ""Be not afeard"" speech from III.ii of _The Tempest_. I've seen a few people talk about how _All Is True_ is the epilogue to Branagh's cinematic engagement with Shakespeare. I sincerely hope not, as we've yet to see him take on the unactable role yet.

The first thing to note about _All Is True_ is how full of references it is to both Shakespeare's plays and incidents (or rumoured incidents) from his life. The idea that Shakespeare retired after the Globe fire is not original to the film, but was first hypothesised by Nicholas Rowe in _Some Account of the Life of Mr. William Shakespear_ (1709), the first Shakespeare biography. Additionally, several of the subplots are taken from real life. For example, as the film shows, when a local man named John Lane (Sean Foley) accused Susanna of adultery, she and Hall sued for slander. When Lane failed to appear to provide evidence of his accusations, he was excommunicated, and Susanna was cleared. Also true is that in 1616, shortly after he married Judith, Quiney was charged with ""_carnal copulation_"" with Margaret Wheeler (Eleanor de Rohan), who had died in childbirth along with the baby. Admitting to the charge, he was fined five shillings, and Shakespeare altered his will so as to safeguard Judith's entitlements should Quiney attempt anything underhand; originally, the will had included a provision ""_vnto my sonne in L_"", but ""_sonne in L_"" was struck out, and Judith's name inserted. A third example is a running joke concerning the matrimonial bed. When Shakespeare returns to Stratford, Anne sees him more as a guest, and so assigns him the best bed, as was customary for visitors, whilst she takes the second-best bed. Over the course of the film, he continually tries to work his way back into her good graces (i.e. back into her bed). Famously, Shakespeare left Anne ""_my second best bed_"" in his will, which some scholars have read as an insult to her, whilst others have suggested the second-best bed was the matrimonial bed, and therefore of great symbolic significance. This is the position the film takes.

Elsewhere, there are references to _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ (the composition of which Anne points out was what Shakespeare did to avoid dealing with the death of Hamnet); _Macbeth_ (""_I once uprooted an entire wood and moved it across a stage to Dunsinane_""); _The Winter's Tale_ (Shakespeare mentions that Ben Jonson ""_laughs at me because I speak no Greek and don't care whether Bohemia has a coast_"", an allusion to William Drummond of Hawthornden's assertion that Jonson mocked Shakespeare for giving the landlocked Bohemia a coastline in the play); the legend that Shakespeare fled Stratford some time prior to 1592 after he was caught poaching deer from Thomas Lucy's land (during an argument, Shakespeare tells Lucy, ""_I wish I had poached your bloody deer_"" - although, in reality, Lucy died in 1600); Robert Greene's contemptuous reference to Shakespeare as, amongst other things, an ""_upstart crow_"" (which Southampton chides him for still being bitter about); and Richard Burbage (Shakespeare refers to him as ""_a brilliant lunatic actor_"" who demanded ""_a bigger show for a smaller budget, and a shorter play with a much longer part for himself_""). There's even a subtle reference to the ridiculous Shakespeare authorship question, when Henry (Phil Dunster), a Cambridge student, travels to Stratford to ask Shakespeare how he knew ""_everything_"", pointing out, ""_there is no corner of this world which you have not explored. No geography of the soul you cannot navigate. How? How do you know?_"" I'm also fairly sure Branagh quotes himself at one point; arriving back at Stratford, a shot from inside the Shakespeare house shows the door opening and Shakespeare standing in the doorway, heavily silhouetted against the light outside, which is exactly how we first see Henry in Branagh's _Henry V_, silhouetted in a doorway.

A particularly funny reference concerns _Titus Andronicus_. When trying to scare Lane out of testifying against Susanna, Shakespeare tells him about the Moorish actor who played Aaron, a man ""_magnificent and terrifying. Mighty like a lion. Strong as a bear. I saw this man tear the heart from a fool who wronged him and eat it raw!_"" Explaining that the man is in love with Susanna, and would do anything for her, even though he knows they can never be together, Shakespeare tells Lane, ""_he swore that if ever she had need, his sword, his claws and his teeth would either defend her or kill for her. Should I tell him of Susanna's current distress?_"" This is intercut with an African-American actor (Nonso Anozie) reciting Aaron's menacing last speech from V.i, in which he brags about his life of misdeeds. However, when Shakespeare tells Anne, she confusedly reminds him that she met the actor who played Aaron, and ""_he was the sweetest chap you should hope to meet_"", to which Shakespeare acknowledges, ""_yes he was, lovely fellow_"".

A critical scene, and easily the best in the film, involves Southampton visiting Stratford. Excitedly telling Anne of the impending visit, she rebukes him, reminding him that a lot of the town's folk read the poems, to which he replies, ""_those sonnets were published illegally. Without my knowledge or consent_"". Later, speaking to Southampton, Shakespeare states,

> _they were only meant for you, Your Grace. Not for any other living soul nor any yet to live. Just you._

This alludes to the theory, popular during the nineteenth century, though somewhat out of favour now, that the original publisher of the sonnets, Thomas Thorpe, did so without Shakespeare's consent. The film also addresses the question of the identity of the ""_fair youth_"" to whom the first 126 poems are addressed. Often assumed to be one and the same as the dedicatee, ""_Mr. W.H._"", (""_To the onlie begetter of these insving sonnets Mr.w.h. All happinesse And that eternitie Promised By Ovr ever-living poet Wisheth The well-wishing Adventvrer in Setting forth_""), the two main (but by no means only) theories as to his identity are Southampton and William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Pembroke was Shakespeare's patron and one of the dedicatees of the _First Folio_ in 1623. Additionally, one of the primary motifs of the first 17 sonnets (the so-called ""Procreation sonnets"") is an attempt to convince the youth to marry, and in 1595, when many of the poems were written, Pembroke was being urged to marry Elizabeth Carey, which he refused to do. Southampton, on the other hand, was the dedicatee of Shakespeare's earlier narrative poems _Venus and Adonis_ and _The Rape of Lucrece_, and was well-known for his good looks.

In the film, there is little room for doubt - Southampton is the fair youth. When he points out, ""_it was only flattery of course_"", Shakespeare responds, ""_just flattery. Except, I spoke from deep within my heart_"", which Southampton dismisses with, ""_well, I was younger then. Younger and prettier_"". Shakespeare then quotes in its entirety ""Sonnet 29"" (""_When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes_""), with Branagh reading it as an agonised ode to an impossible love. He then alludes to the fact he'd always hoped Southampton may have one day reciprocated his love, to which Southampton reacts sternly, telling him, ""y_ou forget yourself, Will. As a poet, you have no equal. And I, like anyone with brain and heart am your humble servant. But as a man, Will, it is not your place to love me_"". Getting up to leave, Southampton then also recites ""Sonnet 29"", with McKellen's intonation changing it into a celebration of the power of art to transcend such foolish distractions as love. It's a beautifully shot, incredibly well-acted, and deeply nuanced scene that, if it accomplishes nothing, serves to remind us just what talented actors can do when reciting the exact same text, simply by modulating their tone.

One of the film's main themes is, of course, family, with Elton's script focusing on how resentful Anne and especially Judith have become of Shakespeare. We don't know a great deal about the real Judith, so much of Elton's characterisation is speculative. The film's Judith is essentially a protofeminist, a brilliant, complex, and acerbic woman railing against the narrow-minded patriarchy her father endorses, boldly telling him, ""_nothing is ever true_"". The likelihood of this being the case is slim at best, but Wilder is excellent in the part and makes Judith much more believable than the character has any right to be. Where Elton is more successful, and on firmer factual ground, is that Shakespeare's interest in his daughters' marriages revolves primarily (if not exclusively) around whether they can give him male grandchildren, now that Hamnet can't carry on the family name. The film acknowledges that Shakespeare was a neglectful father and husband, and never fully gets behind him as he defends himself by citing the cultivation of his genius, pointing out that his talents made the family very wealthy, and thus he should be excused. However, by the end, even he doesn't believe this himself, coming to understand the price his family paid for his greatness.

Aesthetically, cinematographer Zac Nicholson (_The Death of Stalin_; _The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society_; _Red Joan_) seems to have watched one too many Terrence Malick movies during preproduction, but as with everything Branagh directs, there's a sincerity and verisimilitude to the visual design. Nicholson's interior compositions draw inspiration from various Baroque painters, with the daytime scenes recalling Gabriël Metsu and Johannes Vermeer, and the nighttime scenes drawn from the likes of Michelangelo da Caravaggio and Georges de La Tour. His exteriors, as one would expect given the similarity to Malick, are from German Romantics such as Joseph Anton Koch, Caspar David Friedrich, and Carl Blechen. The nighttime compositions are particularly striking, often lit with only practical candles, making use of shallow focus and strong contrast as characters huddle together in narrow shafts of light. Adding to the effect is the excellent production design by James Merifield (_The Deep Blue Sea_; _A Little Chaos_; _Mortdecai_) and Branagh's unexpected, but not unwelcome, use of gentle Dutch angles to underscore moments of heightened tension.

However, there are some considerable problems. First and foremost is the script, which has a strangely formless structure, derived from an extremely episodic organisational principal, with scene after scene addressing one and only one issue at a time, ensuring each issue is cleared before moving onto the next. The accusation against Susanna, for example, is introduced, developed, peaks, and resolves in around 15 minutes, dutifully followed by the next subject, which repeats the pattern. Scenes often involve the characters saying only what is necessary to get to the next scene, with little room to breathe, almost as if we're watching a ""previously on"" montage of a TV show. Because of this, when we do get scenes that are given a bit of time, such as the Southampton scene, they stick out, stylistically detached from the surrounding material. Additionally, what should have formed the core of the story, the allegations against Susanna or the question of Judith's marriage, for example, are instead treated like subplots. The problem with this is that because the main plot has a distinct lack of urgency, and is relatively conflict-free, the subplots come across as much more vital, only for them to be constantly interrupted by the less engaging main narrative.

Another issue with the script is its use of 21st-century gender politics. This kind of retconning, of course, is nothing new, and the question the film raises is an interesting one - was Shakespeare so ensconced in patriarchal thinking that the lack of a male heir blinded him to the fact that one of his daughters may have had the ability to carry on his poetic legacy, if not his name. Maybe he was, I don't know. None of us know. But the film's answer is the worst type of filmic oversimplification. Every woman around Shakespeare is a protofeminist, each of them more progressive (in the modern sense of the term) than him. And thus, the film builds to the moment when he comes to see they were right all along, scolding himself for his short-sightedness and boldly embracing the idea of gender equality. It's a poor attempt to graft contemporary ideology onto an epoch that simply had different beliefs. It's one thing to say Shakespeare may have been in been in favour of the female parts being played by women. It's one thing to say that _The Taming of the Shrew_ may have been written to satirise and mock misogynistic attitudes rather than endorse them. It's something else entirely to say that Shakespeare, by the end of his life, was a feminist, and would eagerly have burnt his bra, given the chance. That takes speculation into the realm of the incongruous, as if Elton and Branagh are afraid to judge him by any standards other than their own.

The casting is also problematic. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Dench and McKellen as much as the next man, and they're both excellent in the film, but that doesn't change the fact that they are both badly miscast. Both play their characters as elderly, but in 1613-1616, Anne (played by the 84-year-old Dench) was 57-60, and Southampton (played by the 79-year-old McKellen) was only 40-43. Additionally, Anne was six years older than Shakespeare, but Dench is 26 years older than Branagh, and it shows. And whilst age discrepancies can often produce fascinating results (in Laurence Olivier's _Hamlet_ (1948), for example, the actress playing Hamlet's mother Gertrude (Eileen Herlie) was 11 years younger than Olivier himself), here it just distracts from the content.

As a massive Kenneth Branagh fan (and a fan of Ben Elton's wonderfully irreverent comedy _Upstart Crow_), I was pretty disappointed with _All Is True_. Equal parts sullen and playful, Branagh's Shakespeare is both an extraordinary genius, not of the ilk of everyday mundanity, and a man who lives in the world and must deal with its absurdities. The film tries to strike a balance between a laid-back and wistful story about a retired writer, and a study of filial grief, with the dawning realisation that much of that grief could have been avoided. Some elements unquestionably work; the Southampton scene, Shakespeare's struggle to reconcile his one-of-kind genius with the personal cost of that genius for both himself and others, Judith's resentment of Hamnet, the night-time photography, the humour, the myriad of references. But a hell of a lot doesn't work. It's an inoffensive and perfectly fine film, but given the director and the subject, it could, and should, have been so much more.,I must admit, this movie sneaked up on me. It starts out slow, and in fact establishes a fairly low key pace through the film. But there are passionate outbursts and exciting reveals. I almost feel sorry for those impatient viewers who are done in by movies that present complex, finely drawn plots. I can only assume they would also nod off while watching an actual Shakespeare play (as in, ""Why don't they speak real English?"").

I suppose the details of All is True aren't all completely true, but even the Bard himself took liberty with his source materials, which, let us remember, was often history written by the winners and those whose heads weren't lopped off.

So I think the layered and admittedly slow moving plot rewards the patient viewer. I appreciated Anne Hathaway in this and wished to see more of her, and the Bard's relationship with his family is finely drawn.
 
If you haven't watched this film yet, check out the trivia entry on this page concerning a scene between Branagh and Dench. It is priceless. Oh, and one negative comment I saw pointed out the apparent disparity in the ages of the three main characters and the historical figures they are based on. I think such inaccuracies are a fair trade off to have Branagh, Dench and McKellon in those roles. And oh yes, the soundtrack music is superb.,","london, england,husband wife relationship,historical figure,family secrets,united kingdom,fictional biography,17th century,father daughter relationship,social prejudices,",29,35,"Kenneth Branagh,"

What’s Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.

KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India’s Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)

The film is narrated through the author’s (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one’s memory to remember the count of characters. Yash’s introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It’s the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.

KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer’s “The Oil”(Dunkirk).

On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur’s music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2.,","gold,undercover,gold mine,one man army,action hero,period film,",17,28,"Prashanth Neel,"

I wanted to stand and applaud, not just for the incredible music or the superb construction, but for the relief of being able to see this footage at all. Thank God we finally can.

There are worse Christmas TV films out there, but <em>'A Gingerbread Romance'</em> fails to entertain even by the smallest of margins. It's all just rough around the edges, particularly with the editing and pacing.

Duane Henry (Adam) and Tia Mowry (Taylor) lead competently, with both of them having likeable qualities and giving alright performances - they just needed more chemistry together to take it up a notch. The rest of the cast are kinda poor, though most only have one or two lines to be fair.

I partly like the premise involving the creation of gingerbread houses, but it's nowhere near compelling - with Adam & Taylor's supposed rivals barely troubling them, so the story lacks any real acceleration.

One thing he hates in his career is drug business, but the rival gang wants him to join with them so they can sneak it without any problem.

But, Maari strongly opposes the plan. Meantime, there is Beeja also known as Thanatos (Tovino Thomas) who has vengeance against Maari for killing his brother. When Beeja escapes from jail, he works with Maari’s rivals and plans a cunning scheme to separate Maari from Kalai.

Beeja’s idea works well and he nearly kills Maari and his lover Aarathu Aanandhi (Sai Pallavi). But they abscond, get married and settles in Tenkasi to lead a peaceful life. But situation forces Maari to return back to his area once again to finish off his rivals.

‘Maari 2’ has all masala ingredients needed for a commercial film. The first half highly depends on Dhanush’s character, but this film is packed with action, romance, friendship, father-son bond, comedy, and all other required ingredients. Especially, the emotional sequences are something no one expect in ‘Maari’ series.

I don't follow a religion, I can handle religious movies so long as they don't preach too much. This one did, but this is not why I'm giving it such a low rating. It earns it's low rating by failing on almost every technical, logical and entertainment level.

Honestly there is so much to hassle about this movie I don't really know where to start.

Despite tonnes of forced exposition the plot makes little to no sense. Characters do and say things for no reason, apart from faith, or an evil lack thereof. Essentially a father and son run and hide from an evil faithless government official who is about as threatening as a box of tissues. They encounter people with faith who help them, or people without faith who hinder them. There is no subtlety, christians are good, everyone else is bad. Every single character is a cliche you have seen somewhere else in a better film. There are no stakes, no tension, because god will intervene whenever anything bad happens.

The film is poorly shot, long tracking shots are juddery and jumpy because they don't have the equipment to properly film them. The old hiding behind a log when the soldier would clearly be able to see you pops up all to often. A sniper who can hit someone in the head in a moving vehicle, through the windshield front on, can't hit the passengers in the car because he's to the left of the vehicle. Yet somehow I guess the devil curved his bullet to go round to the front of the car to hit the driver? Sure, makes as much sense as the rest of the film.

Dialogue is forced and cheesy, badly delivered by people who really want to do a good job, but just don't have the skills to pull it off.

One of the most annoying aspects of the film, is Embry Johnson as Caleb. The dude is going through puberty, and his voice sounds like the acne covered nervous teen from The Simpsons who's voice is permanently breaking. He is so distracting and awful sounding, and can't act to boot. Just wait a few months for his voice to settle, or cast someone else. Every line he utters is fingernails down a blackboard.

This film is an utter waste of time, totally garbage, and I watched the whole goddamn thing because I'm stubborn. I'm now angry having thought about this film this much!,","child prodigy,end of the world,message,prodigy,father son relationship,christian film,",4,3,"Nathan Leon,"

The period setting is captured in opulent detail by Julia Trevelyan Oman's designs, which include authentic Christmas tree decorations that are magically brought to life. Wright's choreography ingeniously incorporates surviving fragments of the ballet's original material, including the sublime pas de deux for the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Prince.

Coaxing a depth of associative meaning from the rhythmic interplay of sound, text, and imagery, The Pearl of Tailorbird perhaps most resembles lyric poetry – or a hermeneutic puzzle – given spatial form.
